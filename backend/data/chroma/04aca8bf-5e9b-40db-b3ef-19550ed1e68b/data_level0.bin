This evolution is driven by technological advancements \nand changing organizational needs, positioning KM as a catalyst for fostering a culture \nthat prioritizes knowledge sharing and collective intelligence. Current trends show a \nsigniﬁcant shift towards integrating enterprise search capabilities and artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence (AI) into KM practices. This integration facilitates a seamless search experience \nand personalized content delivery, enhancing decision-making and problem-solving.\nThe intersection of knowledge management, enterprise search, and AI represents a \nnew frontier in managing organizational knowledge. When combined with KM strat-\negies, AI technologies empower organizations to automate content categorization, \nimprove search accuracy, and generate actionable insights from vast data pools. The \nsynergy between AI and KM platforms transforms traditional information repositories \ninto dynamic, intelligent systems that anticipate user needs and facilitate real-time \nknowledge sharing.\nA cornerstone for organizational success in the rapidly evolving digital landscape char-\nacteristic of modern businesses. The discipline of knowledge management spans de-\ncades and was designed to manage an organization’s knowledge assets systematically. \nIt aims to create value and meet strategic business requirements by fostering a culture \nof continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This introduction sets the foundation for \nunderstanding the breadth and depth of knowledge management and its critical role in \nshaping organizational strategies and outcomes with knowledge management plat-\nform solutions.\nTypes of Knowledge\nRecognizing the different types of knowledge is crucial in any effective knowledge management program. \nKnowledge within organizations can generally be categorized into three main types: tacit, implicit, and \nexplicit.\nTacit Knowledge\n is personal knowledge \nembedded in individual \nexperience. It involves intangible \nfactors such as personal beliefs, \nperspectives, and value systems. \nTacit knowledge is challenging \nto articulate and often shared \nthrough direct person-to-\nperson interaction and personal \nrelationships.\nImplicit Knowledge \n(sometimes considered a subset \nof tacit knowledge) refers to \nknowledge that has not yet \nbeen documented but can be \narticulated and captured with \neffort. It includes routines, \npractices, and procedures that \nemployees are often unaware \nthey possess until they are asked \nto share or describe them.\nExplicit Knowledge \nis knowledge that has been or \ncan be articulated, codiﬁed, \nand stored in certain media. It \nis easily transmitted to others \nand includes policies, procedural \nguides, reports, and documents.\nIncorporating knowledge management strategies that capture all three types creates better outcomes \nbecause it establishes a culture where organizational learning can ﬂourish. Guiding how knowledge is \ncaptured, shared, and utilized across the organization is critical to success.\nThe Purpose and Beneﬁts of \nKnowledge Management\nThe primary purpose of knowledge management is to harness the collective expertise and \ninformation within an organization, making it accessible to the right people at the right \ntime using the best knowledge management system. By leveraging strategic knowledge \nmanagement strategies together with the best knowledge management tools, businesses can:\n1. Enhance decision-making capabilities\n2. Accelerate innovation and responsiveness \n3. Improve customer service and satisfaction\n4. Increase efﬁciency and reduce information silos\n5. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among employees\n6. Optimize operational efﬁciencies\n7. Strengthen data security and compliance\nThe effectiveness of these strategies often hinges on deploying a robust Knowledge \nManagement System (KMS), which serves as the technological backbone for achieving these \nbeneﬁts. A well-implemented KMS supports the capture and dissemination of knowledge \nand ensures the integrity and security of information, making it an indispensable tool for \norganizations aiming to maintain a competitive edge.\nWhat \ndoes a \nknowledge \nmanager \ndo?\nThe speciﬁc tasks of an organization’s Knowledge Manager will depend on the size, needs, and capabilities \nof that organization. For example, some Knowledge Managers will manage large teams while others will be a \none-person department. Generally speaking, Knowledge Managers work cross-functionally with departments \nand teams to establish company knowledge, improve its functionality, establish metrics for its use, encourage \nthe creation and access of company knowledge, and more. While the daily tasks of a Knowledge Manager may \ndiffer, there are some key Knowledge Manager skills that can help you succeed in any setting. Below are our \ntop three.\n1. Promoting Knowledge Sharing In Appealing Ways\nSuccessful Knowledge Manager skills show, rather than just tell, why knowledge management and knowledge \nsharing tools will beneﬁt teams and employees. One of their key responsibilities is to drive awareness and \nadoption of knowledge processes and systems. It is not enough to say “these are the protocols” or even “look \nat these wonderful tools we have at our disposal.”\nTake the time to learn which teams respond best to which communication channels, such as email, face-to-\nface, team meetings, instant messaging, notes, alerts within the knowledge management tool, or even phone \ncalls. Then make sure you’re providing information and encouragement through that channel in an eye-catch-\ning, easy to understand, and helpful way. By practicing these communication habits, a Knowledge Manager \ncan have a direct impact on improving business outcomes through knowledge management adoption.\n2. Facilitating Project Review To Create New Company Knowledge\nGood Knowledge Managers will take a hands-on approach to developing new company knowledge. For ex-\nample, after the completion of a project or campaign, the Knowledge Manager could facilitate a review of the \nlessons learned, good and bad, from the initiative and record their ﬁndings in their knowledge management \nsystem. This information will help future campaign iterations or similar projects be more productive. The \nKnowledge Manager should ensure this new knowledge is easy to ﬁnd and  access within the organization’s \nknowledge management tool.\n3. Personally Connecting With Stakeholders On Knowledge Needs\nThere are essential soft tactics for Knowledge Managers that display their Knowledge Manager skills well. They\nneed the interpersonal ability to connect with a variety of individuals and teams to understand what those key\nstakeholders need from their knowledge management system and how they can be an asset to the knowledge\nmanagement strategy. The Knowledge Manager should feel comfortable connecting with these stakeholders,\nparticularly project leaders. This will allow them to expand an organization’s knowledge offerings and also work\nwith leaders to strategically determine what company knowledge may beneﬁt them on a project or campaign.\nSome Knowledge Manager skills may not come naturally, but they can be learned. Knowledge Managers who \ndevelop these habits will be a great asset to any organization’s knowledge management strategy and overall \nsuccess.\nAs a Knowledge Manager, take the time to understand the habits, needs, and preferences of your stakeholders. \nThis will allow you to communicate more effectively, actively participate in the creation of company knowledge, \nand employ knowledge management strategies that have a real impact on your company’s success.\nA Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a technology-\nbased solution designed to facilitate the capture, \norganization, sharing, and analysis of information within \nan organization. This system enables businesses to leverage \ntheir collective knowledge by making it easily accessible to \nemployees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation. \nBy consolidating data from various sources—documents, video, images, and more—a KMS creates a centralized \nrepository where knowledge is categorized, stored, and retrieved efﬁciently. An effective KMS supports \ncollaboration and knowledge exchange among employees, encouraging a culture where information is stored \nand actively used to drive organizational success. Beyond just data storage, a KMS incorporates tools for \ncontent creation, workﬂow management, and social collaboration, making it a pivotal platform for knowledge-\ndriven processes and strategic decision-making.\nThe top KMS platforms evaluated in this report are Bloomﬁre, Conﬂuence, Document360, eGain, Guru, \nHelpjuice, MarketLogic, Microsoft Sharepoint with Copilot, Oracle, and Salesforce Knowledge \nEach platform has merits for different knowledge needs, and selecting the right platform for your company and \nknowledge goals are essential to the success of your knowledge management program.\nWhat is a \nknowledge \nmanagement \nsystem?\nBuilding a Knowledge Management Strategy\nDeveloping an effective knowledge management strategy involves understanding your organi-\nzation’s objectives, the knowledge needed to attain these objectives, and how this knowledge \nshould be managed and disseminated with knowledge management software solutions.

When selecting a knowledge mangement platform, consider \nthe role that knowledge sharing will play in achieving your goals.\nOne differentiating feature that a knowledge sharing platform has is a Q&A collective knowledge engine. \nThis tool allows users from across the company (or customers, if the platform is external-facing) to post \nquestions and get published responses from subject matter experts. Questions and answers are deep \nindexed within the knowledge sharing platform, which means that other users can search for them using \nkeywords and avoid asking the same question. Over time, companies can build up a thorough collection of \nquestions and answers.\nMany knowledge sharing platforms also allow users across all levels of an organization to share content \nand comment on posts (depending on the permissions established by their administrators). This helps \ndemocratize knowledge across companies: all employees have an opportunity to provide input and share \ntheir expertise, regardless of department or seniority. For example, new hires might comment on training \nmaterials, telling leadership what they think worked well and what was unclear. Leadership could then use \nthis feedback to make improvements to their onboarding process.\nAs you begin your search for a knowledge management solution, think about your company’s goals for the \nsolution. If you’re just looking for a simple repository to publish answers to common questions, building \nor buying a traditional knowledge base may be enough.

I would say that the \"intelligent search\" \nneeds improvement. There are times when we search using a speciﬁc keyword but it is too far from what we \nwere looking for. There are also cards that would come up but are not related to the word we used.\nWhat do you like best about Guru?\nWe use Guru in our Go-To-Market (GTM) department, which includes Sales, Customer Success, Sales En-\nablement, and Partners team.

Introduction to 
Knowledge 
Management
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
It has evolved beyond a multidisciplinary approach to delivering and managing an en-
terprise’s knowledge and information assets to become a strategic enabler of organiza-
tional innovation and efﬁciency. This evolution is driven by technological advancements 
and changing organizational needs, positioning KM as a catalyst for fostering a culture 
that prioritizes knowledge sharing and collective intelligence. Current trends show a 
signiﬁcant shift towards integrating enterprise search capabilities and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence (AI) into KM practices. This integration facilitates a seamless search experience 
and personalized content delivery, enhancing decision-making and problem-solving.
The intersection of knowledge management, enterprise search, and AI represents a 
new frontier in managing organizational knowledge. When combined with KM strat-
egies, AI technologies empower organizations to automate content categorization, 
improve search accuracy, and generate actionable insights from vast data pools. The 
synergy between AI and KM platforms transforms traditional information repositories 
into dynamic, intelligent systems that anticipate user needs and facilitate real-time 
knowledge sharing.
A cornerstone for organizational success in the rapidly evolving digital landscape char-
acteristic of modern businesses. The discipline of knowledge management spans de-
cades and was designed to manage an organization’s knowledge assets systematically. 
It aims to create value and meet strategic business requirements by fostering a culture 
of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This introduction sets the foundation for 
understanding the breadth and depth of knowledge management and its critical role in 
shaping organizational strategies and outcomes with knowledge management plat-
form solutions.
Types of Knowledge
Recognizing the different types of knowledge is crucial in any effective knowledge management program. 
Knowledge within organizations can generally be categorized into three main types: tacit, implicit, and 
explicit.
Tacit Knowledge
 is personal knowledge 
embedded in individual 
experience. It involves intangible 
factors such as personal beliefs, 
perspectives, and value systems. 
Tacit knowledge is challenging 
to articulate and often shared 
through direct person-to-
person interaction and personal 
relationships.
Implicit Knowledge 
(sometimes considered a subset 
of tacit knowledge) refers to 
knowledge that has not yet 
been documented but can be 
articulated and captured with 
effort. It includes routines, 
practices, and procedures that 
employees are often unaware 
they possess until they are asked 
to share or describe them.
Explicit Knowledge 
is knowledge that has been or 
can be articulated, codiﬁed, 
and stored in certain media. It 
is easily transmitted to others 
and includes policies, procedural 
guides, reports, and documents.
Incorporating knowledge management strategies that capture all three types creates better outcomes 
because it establishes a culture where organizational learning can ﬂourish. Guiding how knowledge is 
captured, shared, and utilized across the organization is critical to success.
The Purpose and Beneﬁts of 
Knowledge Management
The primary purpose of knowledge management is to harness the collective expertise and 
information within an organization, making it accessible to the right people at the right 
time using the best knowledge management system. By leveraging strategic knowledge 
management strategies together with the best knowledge management tools, businesses can:
1. Enhance decision-making capabilities
2. Accelerate innovation and responsiveness 
3. Improve customer service and satisfaction
4. Increase efﬁciency and reduce information silos
5. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among employees
6. Optimize operational efﬁciencies
7. Strengthen data security and compliance
The effectiveness of these strategies often hinges on deploying a robust Knowledge 
Management System (KMS), which serves as the technological backbone for achieving these 
beneﬁts. A well-implemented KMS supports the capture and dissemination of knowledge 
and ensures the integrity and security of information, making it an indispensable tool for 
organizations aiming to maintain a competitive edge.
What 
does a 
knowledge 
manager 
do?
The speciﬁc tasks of an organization’s Knowledge Manager will depend on the size, needs, and capabilities 
of that organization. For example, some Knowledge Managers will manage large teams while others will be a 
one-person department. Generally speaking, Knowledge Managers work cross-functionally with departments 
and teams to establish company knowledge, improve its functionality, establish metrics for its use, encourage 
the creation and access of company knowledge, and more. While the daily tasks of a Knowledge Manager may 
differ, there are some key Knowledge Manager skills that can help you succeed in any setting. Below are our 
top three.
1. Promoting Knowledge Sharing In Appealing Ways
Successful Knowledge Manager skills show, rather than just tell, why knowledge management and knowledge 
sharing tools will beneﬁt teams and employees. One of their key responsibilities is to drive awareness and 
adoption of knowledge processes and systems. It is not enough to say “these are the protocols” or even “look 
at these wonderful tools we have at our disposal.”
Take the time to learn which teams respond best to which communication channels, such as email, face-to-
face, team meetings, instant messaging, notes, alerts within the knowledge management tool, or even phone 
calls. Then make sure you’re providing information and encouragement through that channel in an eye-catch-
ing, easy to understand, and helpful way. By practicing these communication habits, a Knowledge Manager 
can have a direct impact on improving business outcomes through knowledge management adoption.
2. Facilitating Project Review To Create New Company Knowledge
Good Knowledge Managers will take a hands-on approach to developing new company knowledge. For ex-
ample, after the completion of a project or campaign, the Knowledge Manager could facilitate a review of the 
lessons learned, good and bad, from the initiative and record their ﬁndings in their knowledge management 
system. This information will help future campaign iterations or similar projects be more productive. The 
Knowledge Manager should ensure this new knowledge is easy to ﬁnd and  access within the organization’s 
knowledge management tool.
3. Personally Connecting With Stakeholders On Knowledge Needs
There are essential soft tactics for Knowledge Managers that display their Knowledge Manager skills well. They
need the interpersonal ability to connect with a variety of individuals and teams to understand what those key
stakeholders need from their knowledge management system and how they can be an asset to the knowledge
management strategy. The Knowledge Manager should feel comfortable connecting with these stakeholders,
particularly project leaders. This will allow them to expand an organization’s knowledge offerings and also work
with leaders to strategically determine what company knowledge may beneﬁt them on a project or campaign.
Some Knowledge Manager skills may not come naturally, but they can be learned. Knowledge Managers who 
develop these habits will be a great asset to any organization’s knowledge management strategy and overall 
success.
As a Knowledge Manager, take the time to understand the habits, needs, and preferences of your stakeholders. 
This will allow you to communicate more effectively, actively participate in the creation of company knowledge, 
and employ knowledge management strategies that have a real impact on your company’s success.
A Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a technology-
based solution designed to facilitate the capture, 
organization, sharing, and analysis of information within 
an organization. This system enables businesses to leverage 
their collective knowledge by making it easily accessible to 
employees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation. 
By consolidating data from various sources—documents, video, images, and more—a KMS creates a centralized 
repository where knowledge is categorized, stored, and retrieved efﬁciently. An effective KMS supports 
collaboration and knowledge exchange among employees, encouraging a culture where information is stored 
and actively used to drive organizational success. Beyond just data storage, a KMS incorporates tools for 
content creation, workﬂow management, and social collaboration, making it a pivotal platform for knowledge-
driven processes and strategic decision-making.
The top KMS platforms evaluated in this report are Bloomﬁre, Conﬂuence, Document360, eGain, Guru, 
Helpjuice, MarketLogic, Microsoft Sharepoint with Copilot, Oracle, and Salesforce Knowledge 
Each platform has merits for different knowledge needs, and selecting the right platform for your company and 
knowledge goals are essential to the success of your knowledge management program.

Building a Knowledge Management Strategy
Developing an effective knowledge management strategy involves understanding your organi-
zation’s objectives, the knowledge needed to attain these objectives, and how this knowledge 
should be managed and disseminated with knowledge management software solutions. The 
right KM software solution to dissminate organizational knowledge and expertise is essental 
for sustained knowledge managment success.  The key components include:
Encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Identifying and cataloging knowledge assets (peforming a knowledge audit)
Establishing the approach to achitect knowledge assets for ease of use and 
accessibility 
Establishing governance and processes to maintain knowledge quality
Idenﬁying and implementing the right knowledge management software 
platform that aligns with the KM strategy
The journey to effective knowledge management begins with a solid foundation. This critical 
ﬁrst step involves a comprehensive assessment of your organization’s current state of knowl-
edge – understanding what information you have, where it resides, and how it is accessed and 
used. A crucial part of this process is identifying your business’ speciﬁc knowledge needs and 
the gaps in your current knowledge management system. It’s about pinpointing where your 
knowledge assets fall short and creating a plan to bridge these gaps.
To gain a holistic view, you should involve various organizational stakeholders in this initial 
phase. This collaborative approach ensures that your knowledge management strategy is 
inclusive and aligns with your organization’s diverse needs and functions. Whether streamlin-
ing decision-making, enhancing employee collaboration, or improving customer engagement, 
understanding these goals is paramount. With this insight, you can begin to chart a course 
for along the knowledge implementation roadmap that addresses your immediate needs and 
positions your organization for future growth and adaptability, leveraging a KMS to transform 
these plans into actionable strategies.

learning support a culture of continuous learning, driving organizational innovation and performance.

Breaking down silos and creating a culture of knowledge sharing across departments, regions and busi-
ness units is not easy. But with the correct tools and a well developed knowledge sharing strategy, it can 
unlock incredibly powerful productivity gains. When selecting a knowledge mangement platform, consider 
the role that knowledge sharing will play in achieving your goals.
One differentiating feature that a knowledge sharing platform has is a Q&A collective knowledge engine. 
This tool allows users from across the company (or customers, if the platform is external-facing) to post 
questions and get published responses from subject matter experts. Questions and answers are deep 
indexed within the knowledge sharing platform, which means that other users can search for them using 
keywords and avoid asking the same question. Over time, companies can build up a thorough collection of 
questions and answers.
Many knowledge sharing platforms also allow users across all levels of an organization to share content 
and comment on posts (depending on the permissions established by their administrators). This helps 
democratize knowledge across companies: all employees have an opportunity to provide input and share 
their expertise, regardless of department or seniority. For example, new hires might comment on training 
materials, telling leadership what they think worked well and what was unclear. Leadership could then use 
this feedback to make improvements to their onboarding process.
As you begin your search for a knowledge management solution, think about your company’s goals for the 
solution. If you’re just looking for a simple repository to publish answers to common questions, building 
or buying a traditional knowledge base may be enough. However, if your company has a high volume of 
content that employees need to be able to search quickly, and if you want employees or customers to en-
gage with company content and contribute their own knowledge, you should be searching for a knowledge 
sharing platform.

Comprehensive Analysis of
Knowledge Management
Software Platforms
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
Software Platforms that solve the technological challenges of knowledge management  
and organizational practices must support all aspects of identifying, capturing, 
evaluating, retrieving, and sharing an enterprise’s information assets.
When considering the individual attributes of knowledge management systems, each platform has been 
independently evaluated against the criteria. This analysis purposefully selected platforms that support 
the entire knowledge management lifecycle, from knowledge creation, sharing, and integration with other 
business tools. Generative AI promises to disrupt the traditional knowledge management system market; 
however, early analysis of LLMs connected to enterprise search tools has shown mixed results in maintaining 
secure access to conﬁdential information and referencing incomplete, outdated, or redundant content to 
inform the model. Knowledge management software with curated and certiﬁed sources of knowledge can 
provide more accurate, secure, and reliable responses via generative AI. The convergence of these tools – 
generative AI, enterprise search, and knowledge management platforms will be a trend to watch in 2024 and 
2025.
Enterprises looking to leverage artiﬁcial intelligence to improve their knowledge management practices must 
consider all of the appropriate criteria applicable to their unique business practices. In addition to the 12 crite-
ria identiﬁed here, adopting ethical AI practices is crucial to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability 
in managing and utilizing knowledge. AI ethics is a collection of moral principles, processes, and techniques 
intended to advise and direct the development and responsible use of artiﬁcial intelligence technology.
