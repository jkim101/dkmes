Introduction to 
Knowledge 
Management
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
It has evolved beyond a multidisciplinary approach to delivering and managing an en-
terprise’s knowledge and information assets to become a strategic enabler of organiza-
tional innovation and efﬁciency. This evolution is driven by technological advancements 
and changing organizational needs, positioning KM as a catalyst for fostering a culture 
that prioritizes knowledge sharing and collective intelligence. Current trends show a 
signiﬁcant shift towards integrating enterprise search capabilities and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence (AI) into KM practices. This integration facilitates a seamless search experience 
and personalized content delivery, enhancing decision-making and problem-solving.
The intersection of knowledge management, enterprise search, and AI represents a 
new frontier in managing organizational knowledge. When combined with KM strat-
egies, AI technologies empower organizations to automate content categorization, 
improve search accuracy, and generate actionable insights from vast data pools. The 
synergy between AI and KM platforms transforms traditional information repositories 
into dynamic, intelligent systems that anticipate user needs and facilitate real-time 
knowledge sharing.
A cornerstone for organizational success in the rapidly evolving digital landscape char-
acteristic of modern businesses. The discipline of knowledge management spans de-
cades and was designed to manage an organization’s knowledge assets systematically. 
It aims to create value and meet strategic business requirements by fostering a culture 
of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This introduction sets the foundation for 
understanding the breadth and depth of knowledge management and its critical role in 
shaping organizational strategies and outcomes with knowledge management plat-
form solutions.
Types of Knowledge
Recognizing the different types of knowledge is crucial in any effective knowledge management program. 
Knowledge within organizations can generally be categorized into three main types: tacit, implicit, and 
explicit.
Tacit Knowledge
 is personal knowledge 
embedded in individual 
experience. It involves intangible 
factors such as personal beliefs, 
perspectives, and value systems. 
Tacit knowledge is challenging 
to articulate and often shared 
through direct person-to-
person interaction and personal 
relationships.
Implicit Knowledge 
(sometimes considered a subset 
of tacit knowledge) refers to 
knowledge that has not yet 
been documented but can be 
articulated and captured with 
effort. It includes routines, 
practices, and procedures that 
employees are often unaware 
they possess until they are asked 
to share or describe them.
Explicit Knowledge 
is knowledge that has been or 
can be articulated, codiﬁed, 
and stored in certain media. It 
is easily transmitted to others 
and includes policies, procedural 
guides, reports, and documents.
Incorporating knowledge management strategies that capture all three types creates better outcomes 
because it establishes a culture where organizational learning can ﬂourish. Guiding how knowledge is 
captured, shared, and utilized across the organization is critical to success.
The Purpose and Beneﬁts of 
Knowledge Management
The primary purpose of knowledge management is to harness the collective expertise and 
information within an organization, making it accessible to the right people at the right 
time using the best knowledge management system. By leveraging strategic knowledge 
management strategies together with the best knowledge management tools, businesses can:
1. Enhance decision-making capabilities
2. Accelerate innovation and responsiveness 
3. Improve customer service and satisfaction
4. Increase efﬁciency and reduce information silos
5. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among employees
6. Optimize operational efﬁciencies
7. Strengthen data security and compliance
The effectiveness of these strategies often hinges on deploying a robust Knowledge 
Management System (KMS), which serves as the technological backbone for achieving these 
beneﬁts. A well-implemented KMS supports the capture and dissemination of knowledge 
and ensures the integrity and security of information, making it an indispensable tool for 
organizations aiming to maintain a competitive edge.
What 
does a 
knowledge 
manager 
do?
The speciﬁc tasks of an organization’s Knowledge Manager will depend on the size, needs, and capabilities 
of that organization. For example, some Knowledge Managers will manage large teams while others will be a 
one-person department. Generally speaking, Knowledge Managers work cross-functionally with departments 
and teams to establish company knowledge, improve its functionality, establish metrics for its use, encourage 
the creation and access of company knowledge, and more. While the daily tasks of a Knowledge Manager may 
differ, there are some key Knowledge Manager skills that can help you succeed in any setting. Below are our 
top three.
1. Promoting Knowledge Sharing In Appealing Ways
Successful Knowledge Manager skills show, rather than just tell, why knowledge management and knowledge 
sharing tools will beneﬁt teams and employees. One of their key responsibilities is to drive awareness and 
adoption of knowledge processes and systems. It is not enough to say “these are the protocols” or even “look 
at these wonderful tools we have at our disposal.”
Take the time to learn which teams respond best to which communication channels, such as email, face-to-
face, team meetings, instant messaging, notes, alerts within the knowledge management tool, or even phone 
calls. Then make sure you’re providing information and encouragement through that channel in an eye-catch-
ing, easy to understand, and helpful way. By practicing these communication habits, a Knowledge Manager 
can have a direct impact on improving business outcomes through knowledge management adoption.
2. Facilitating Project Review To Create New Company Knowledge
Good Knowledge Managers will take a hands-on approach to developing new company knowledge. For ex-
ample, after the completion of a project or campaign, the Knowledge Manager could facilitate a review of the 
lessons learned, good and bad, from the initiative and record their ﬁndings in their knowledge management 
system. This information will help future campaign iterations or similar projects be more productive. The 
Knowledge Manager should ensure this new knowledge is easy to ﬁnd and  access within the organization’s 
knowledge management tool.
3. Personally Connecting With Stakeholders On Knowledge Needs
There are essential soft tactics for Knowledge Managers that display their Knowledge Manager skills well. They
need the interpersonal ability to connect with a variety of individuals and teams to understand what those key
stakeholders need from their knowledge management system and how they can be an asset to the knowledge
management strategy. The Knowledge Manager should feel comfortable connecting with these stakeholders,
particularly project leaders. This will allow them to expand an organization’s knowledge offerings and also work
with leaders to strategically determine what company knowledge may beneﬁt them on a project or campaign.
Some Knowledge Manager skills may not come naturally, but they can be learned. Knowledge Managers who 
develop these habits will be a great asset to any organization’s knowledge management strategy and overall 
success.
As a Knowledge Manager, take the time to understand the habits, needs, and preferences of your stakeholders. 
This will allow you to communicate more effectively, actively participate in the creation of company knowledge, 
and employ knowledge management strategies that have a real impact on your company’s success.
A Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a technology-
based solution designed to facilitate the capture, 
organization, sharing, and analysis of information within 
an organization. This system enables businesses to leverage 
their collective knowledge by making it easily accessible to 
employees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation. 
By consolidating data from various sources—documents, video, images, and more—a KMS creates a centralized 
repository where knowledge is categorized, stored, and retrieved efﬁciently. An effective KMS supports 
collaboration and knowledge exchange among employees, encouraging a culture where information is stored 
and actively used to drive organizational success. Beyond just data storage, a KMS incorporates tools for 
content creation, workﬂow management, and social collaboration, making it a pivotal platform for knowledge-
driven processes and strategic decision-making.
The top KMS platforms evaluated in this report are Bloomﬁre, Conﬂuence, Document360, eGain, Guru, 
Helpjuice, MarketLogic, Microsoft Sharepoint with Copilot, Oracle, and Salesforce Knowledge 
Each platform has merits for different knowledge needs, and selecting the right platform for your company and 
knowledge goals are essential to the success of your knowledge management program.

zation’s objectives, the knowledge needed to attain these objectives, and how this knowledge 
should be managed and disseminated with knowledge management software solutions. The 
right KM software solution to dissminate organizational knowledge and expertise is essental 
for sustained knowledge managment success.  The key components include:
Encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Identifying and cataloging knowledge assets (peforming a knowledge audit)
Establishing the approach to achitect knowledge assets for ease of use and 
accessibility 
Establishing governance and processes to maintain knowledge quality
Idenﬁying and implementing the right knowledge management software 
platform that aligns with the KM strategy
The journey to effective knowledge management begins with a solid foundation. This critical 
ﬁrst step involves a comprehensive assessment of your organization’s current state of knowl-
edge – understanding what information you have, where it resides, and how it is accessed and 
used. A crucial part of this process is identifying your business’ speciﬁc knowledge needs and 
the gaps in your current knowledge management system. It’s about pinpointing where your 
knowledge assets fall short and creating a plan to bridge these gaps.
To gain a holistic view, you should involve various organizational stakeholders in this initial 
phase. This collaborative approach ensures that your knowledge management strategy is 
inclusive and aligns with your organization’s diverse needs and functions. Whether streamlin-
ing decision-making, enhancing employee collaboration, or improving customer engagement, 
understanding these goals is paramount. With this insight, you can begin to chart a course 
for along the knowledge implementation roadmap that addresses your immediate needs and 
positions your organization for future growth and adaptability, leveraging a KMS to transform 
these plans into actionable strategies.

keywords and avoid asking the same question. Over time, companies can build up a thorough collection of 
questions and answers.
Many knowledge sharing platforms also allow users across all levels of an organization to share content 
and comment on posts (depending on the permissions established by their administrators). This helps 
democratize knowledge across companies: all employees have an opportunity to provide input and share 
their expertise, regardless of department or seniority. For example, new hires might comment on training 
materials, telling leadership what they think worked well and what was unclear. Leadership could then use 
this feedback to make improvements to their onboarding process.
As you begin your search for a knowledge management solution, think about your company’s goals for the 
solution. If you’re just looking for a simple repository to publish answers to common questions, building 
or buying a traditional knowledge base may be enough. However, if your company has a high volume of 
content that employees need to be able to search quickly, and if you want employees or customers to en-
gage with company content and contribute their own knowledge, you should be searching for a knowledge 
sharing platform.

Comprehensive Analysis of
Knowledge Management
Software Platforms
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
Software Platforms that solve the technological challenges of knowledge management  
and organizational practices must support all aspects of identifying, capturing, 
evaluating, retrieving, and sharing an enterprise’s information assets.
When considering the individual attributes of knowledge management systems, each platform has been 
independently evaluated against the criteria. This analysis purposefully selected platforms that support 
the entire knowledge management lifecycle, from knowledge creation, sharing, and integration with other 
business tools. Generative AI promises to disrupt the traditional knowledge management system market; 
however, early analysis of LLMs connected to enterprise search tools has shown mixed results in maintaining 
secure access to conﬁdential information and referencing incomplete, outdated, or redundant content to 
inform the model. Knowledge management software with curated and certiﬁed sources of knowledge can 
provide more accurate, secure, and reliable responses via generative AI. The convergence of these tools – 
generative AI, enterprise search, and knowledge management platforms will be a trend to watch in 2024 and 
2025.
Enterprises looking to leverage artiﬁcial intelligence to improve their knowledge management practices must 
consider all of the appropriate criteria applicable to their unique business practices. In addition to the 12 crite-
ria identiﬁed here, adopting ethical AI practices is crucial to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability 
in managing and utilizing knowledge. AI ethics is a collection of moral principles, processes, and techniques 
intended to advise and direct the development and responsible use of artiﬁcial intelligence technology.

noted absence of an accompanying mobile application.
The platform’s strong score for delivering ROI (8/10) indicates Document360’s transparent and scalable 
pricing model and signiﬁcant value, particularly for organizations that want to optimize their knowledge 
management initiatives. The platform’s strength lies in its robust authoring tools, collaborative features, 
and ﬂexibility in handling various content formats, making it a versatile solution for knowledge manage-
ment needs. 
Despite these strengths, Document360’s overall score of 7.7 out of 10 underscores this platform’s lack of 
mobile optimization, real-time communication, and deﬁciencies in integrating external content sources 
directly into the knowledge base, which would substantially enrich the platform’s capabilities.
Document 360

ministrative capabilities
Reviews
What do you like best about Document360?
I love how I can pull in team members to write and review various articles on which they are the SME. It 
ensures that our documentation is accurate, and continuously updated.
What do you dislike about Document360?
The User Interface can be a bit challenging to navigate. The different editor versions can not be switched 
between, and this makes the review and editing process more challenging that needed.
What do you like best about Document360?
Document360 integrates with a variety of tools that our company already uses, which made it stand 
out as a choice for us while we assessed new tools.
In addition to integrations, Document360 also has great support for knowledge bases with large vol-
umes of articles. The article URL redirect tool and variables are particularly useful.
What do you dislike about Document360?
While it does integrate with many tools, some of the integrations are not as robust as we would like. 
There are some things we would like to customize or have more control over in our integrations, but 
Document360 does not grant that level of control.

In the Search & Discovery (9/10) arena, eGain excels thanks to its integration of Semantic & AI technol-
ogies within the eGain Knowledge Hub™. These innovations ensure efﬁcient and accurate information 
retrieval, which is crucial for dynamic customer service environments. While eGain supports its  Knowl-
edge Authoring (7/10) by adequately supporting article creation and publishing, it has shortcomings in 
managing deletions, which may introduce risks related to content recovery and unauthorized access. It is 
a big area for future improvement.
Administrative Capabilities (6/10) reveal eGain’s extensive and complex taxonomy and data migration 
features, suggesting that achieving its full potential requires specialized expertise for optimal manage-

ty as content scales
Strong search and discovery features, 
backed by cutting-edge semantic and AI 
technologies
Limited support for rendering and search-
ing attached documents
Good integration capabilities Lacks customization options 
Guru’s strength in Search and Discovery (9/10) is signiﬁcantly enhanced by its Semantic and AI tech-
nologies, ensuring fast and accurate retrieval of information tailored to user needs. The platform incor-
porates AI Capabilities (8/10) across key areas, providing relevant content suggestions, streamlining 
search efﬁciency, and identifying subject matter experts to aid users. 
While Guru excels in these aspects, it lacks support for fully rendering and searching attached docu-

and content accessibility features can be improved so that all types of knowledge are discoverable and 
included in AI-driven suggestions.
The platform’s Reporting & Analytics (7/10) offers deep insights into usage and content engagement, 
enabling organizations to identify and address knowledge gaps effectively. Despite its strengths, Guru 
could beneﬁt from enhanced customization options, as reﬂected in its Administrative Capabilities

Reviews
What do you like best about Guru?
I like how Guru is very organized despite having different departments in our account. Team Leads can also 
create their own cards and knowledge base that is helpful for their teams. This tool will make sure that your 
team is updated with everything and you will even see how many people from your team have read the im-
portant update. You will also see which card is very useful since you will see how many people are using that 
speciﬁc card and how many times they've used it.
What do you dislike about Guru?
In our company, their features are very useful and nearly perfect. I would say that the "intelligent search" 
needs improvement. There are times when we search using a speciﬁc keyword but it is too far from what we 
were looking for. There are also cards that would come up but are not related to the word we used.
What do you like best about Guru?
We use Guru in our Go-To-Market (GTM) department, which includes Sales, Customer Success, Sales En-
ablement, and Partners team. It's a great knowledge repository that allows you to document processes and 
capture product knowledge. You can create collections for various products and include anything from FAQ, 
product overviews, and suggested language.
End-users can submit comments that are routed to the admins should you have any questions about the 
content. You can also see if this Guru card is up-to-date or if the information has been unveriﬁed. Guru card 
owners will receive an update letting them know there are comments that need to be addressed or that it's 
time to review the content to ensure accuracy.
I also love that Guru integrates with various tools we use at our company: Salesforce, Front, etc.
What do you dislike about Guru?
Without a proper content strategy, Guru can become messy. Organizations really need to spend time plan-
ning who will own what and who is responsible for creating and updating their Guru cards.
Sometimes users are unable to ﬁnd Guru cards because the "right" keyword wasn't included in the Keywords 
section. I have provided this feedback to our internal teams and Guru.

The platform’s Search & Discovery (8/10) features effectively leverage AI and semantic search, though it 
lacks generative AI capabilities (5/10), which are increasingly common in other knowledge management 
platforms. Its Knowledge Authoring (7/10) capabilities are robust, with rich text editing and various con-
tent types supported. However, metadata customization requires external services, indicating a need for 
greater autonomy in content management.
Reporting and analytics (8/10) are one of HelpJuice’s strengths, offering in-depth insights into content 
utilization and knowledge base performance. However, despite these robust reporting capabilities, the 
reporting setup process requires more effort. The platform’s Administrative Capabilities (7/10) include 
solid content management features but lack detailed customization options like advanced tagging, 
which can impact the ﬂexibility of this solution.
Collaboration (5/10) is basic, focusing mainly on content feedback without fostering broader collabo-
rative efforts. HelpJuice’s Integration Capabilities (6/10) provide essential connections with platforms 
like Google Analytics but miss crucial CRM integrations, limiting comprehensive customer experience 
management.
Security & Compliance (8/10) are well addressed with adherence to GDPR and HIPAA data security 
compliance, although there’s room for additional enhancements to match evolving security standards. 
HelpJuice’s Customer Support (8/10) features offer effective assistance, though some users report

The ROI (8/10) of HelpJuice emphasizes its competitive edge in terms of cost-efﬁciency and support for

aren't enabled there.

MarketLogic presents a user-friendly interface, scoring a commendable 8/10 in Ease of Use. Its 
intuitive design and integration of varied data sources simplify navigation and access, promoting 
an efﬁcient knowledge management experience. However, the platform demands a certain level of 
expertise in information architecture for optimal utilization.
MarketLogic
MarketLogic is speciﬁcally designed for market research and insights across ﬁnance, retail, and healthcare 
sectors. It streamlines consumer and market data analysis and assimilation, promoting informed strategic 
decisions.
PROS CONS
User-friendly interface and efﬁcient inte-
gration of diverse data sources
Requires expertise in information architec-
ture for optimal use
Strong search and discovery features Integration and security features fall short 
of industry standards
Comprehensive reporting and analytics 
tools
UI can be overwhelming for new users
In Search & Discovery (8/10), MarketLogic shines with its Semantic & AI capabilities, ensuring precise and 
rapid retrieval of necessary insights. This is somewhat constrained by the platform’s customization limitations 
— particularly its inability to incorporate organization-speciﬁc metadata, which could otherwise enhance the 
contextual alignment of search results with user needs.
When examining AI Capabilities (8/10) and Knowledge Authoring (6/10), MarketLogic shows varied results. 
Despite boasting robust AI-driven search functionalities, the platform’s application of AI beyond search is 
restricted, impacting its adaptability to diverse user scenarios. Knowledge authoring underscores another 
critical shortcoming — the absence of new content creation and customization without signiﬁcant external 
intervention, curbing the dynamism typically associated with KM systems.
Reporting & Analytics (8/10) stand out as a strength, with MarketLogic offering insightful tools that track and 
analyze knowledge usage. This capability is crucial for identifying operational inefﬁciencies and knowledge 
gaps, fostering an environment geared towards continuous improvement and strategic foresight.
Administrative Capabilities (7/10) and Collaboration Capabilities (7/10) reﬂect a more constrained operational 
ﬂexibility. While MarketLogic provides basic administrative tools and collaborative features, any substantial 
customization or deeper collaborative engagements necessitate direct involvement from MarketLogic’s team, 
limiting self-sufﬁciency and spontaneous team interactions.
The same narrative extends to the platform’s Integration Capabilities (7/10) and Security & Compliance (6/10) 
aspects. MarketLogic exhibits solid foundational strengths but reveals gaps in software integration and securi-
ty features, areas where it could enhance its alignment and compliance with broader industry standards.
The Customer Support (7/10) framework aligns with conventional B2B SaaS models, offering standard support 
but failing to exceed customer expectations without additional investments.
In Technical Performance & Innovation (7/10), MarketLogic demonstrates competent data handling and a for-
ward-looking approach to market intelligence. However, it faces the challenge of expanding its innovative edge 
within the KM domain.
MarketLogic’s ROI (7/10) and value proposition are weighed against its pricing and the necessity for specialized 
support. While it harbors the potential to transform market insights into actionable intelligence, prospective 
clients must consider the balance between its analytical capabilities and the total cost of ownership. Market-
Logic’s offerings are nuanced, reﬂecting a blend of strengths and areas needing enhancement, culminating in 
an overall score of 7.1 out of 10.

leap in simplifying site management and content development, targeting UI/UX designers and power users 
with tools to efﬁciently transform content into engaging SharePoint pages. Despite its promising features, 
SharePoint with Copilot’s Ease of Use (6/10) relies heavily on the initial setup by staff skilled in information 
architecture, creating a steeper learning curve for the broad population of employees and the necessity for 
proﬁciency t in software engineering to leverage Copilot’s open-ended AI functionality fully.

The Search & Discovery aspect of Sharepoint, rated at (9/10), beneﬁts from AI innovations and, most 
notably, improvements in search efﬁciency and accuracy. However, Copilot’s inconsistent performance 
in extracting precise answers from documents opens up room for improvement. This platform’s Knowl-
edge Authoring (6/10) functionality is supported by robust text editing, intelligent metadata manage-
ment, and AI-driven templates. Still, the capture of a diverse set of content formats remains limited 
without external integrations.
Administrative Capabilities (8/10) and Reporting & Analytics (7/10) are some of the most vital aspects 
of SharePoint with Copilot. They allow for streamlining workﬂows using AI-enhanced custom reporting 
tools. Effectively utilizing these advanced features requires specialized training resources for proper 
administration, underlining a gap between this software’s full reporting potential and ease of access.
Collaboration (7/10) is effectively facilitated through SharePoint’s deep integration with Microsoft 365 
applications, promoting seamless cooperative efforts on documents and projects. Integration Capabili-
ties (7/10) highlight SharePoint’s strong connections within the M365 suite, such as Dynamics CRM and 
ERP systems, within the Microsoft suite. Extending these integrations beyond the Microsoft ecosystem 
necessitates custom development, which can create limitations.
Customer support (5/10) includes extensive self-service resources, but the level of support varies by 
service tier, and more in-depth, personalized support requires additional contracts.
The ROI of SharePoint with Copilot (5/10) is a balancing act between its monthly $30 per user cost and 
the potential for enhanced productivity and collaboration. Successful deployment and utilization de-
mand signiﬁcant investment in training and technical resources, underscoring the importance of con-
sidering total cost and organizational readiness for adopting this advanced platform. With an overall 
score of 7.9 out of 10, Microsoft SharePoint with Copilot offers a standard knowledge management and 
content creation solution with signiﬁcant cost considerations, complexity, and the need for specialized 
implementation expertise.

What do you like best about Microsoft SharePoint?
"I ﬁnd Microsoft SharePoint particularly impressive for its excellent collaboration capabilities and robust 
document management system. The platform's ability to be customized to ﬁt various business needs, 
along with its seamless integration with the Microsoft ecosystem, makes it a standout choice. It's also 
notable for its strong security measures, scalability, and support for automated workﬂows. The fact that 
it allows remote access is a huge plus, especially in today's increasingly digital and remote work environ-
ments. The community around SharePoint is also a great resource, and the regular updates and improve-
ments from Microsoft ensure it stays relevant and efﬁcient."
What do you dislike about Microsoft SharePoint?
"SharePoint's complexity and steep learning curve can be overwhelming, especially for new users. It often 
faces performance issues in larger systems and can be costly for small businesses. Its strong tie to the 
Microsoft ecosystem may not ﬁt well with varied software environments. Customization options are good 
but can feel limited in design and interface. Migrating or integrating SharePoint is complex and time-con-
suming. Frequent updates, although useful, can disrupt established workﬂows. Also, SharePoint Online 
requires a stable internet connection, which is a drawback in areas with limited connectivity."
What do you like best about Microsoft SharePoint?
you can access the docs in SharePoint from anywhere as long as you have internet and SharePoint access.
The system does have decent tech and customer support to help navigate issues
it also has various features that can make it the go-to place for all your work data platforms.
What do you dislike about Microsoft SharePoint?
it is not the most user-friendly. Often it's difﬁcult to ﬁnd a document and often when someone else shares

this platform lacks support for newsletters and feeds. Oracle does support a robust set of integra-

not perform as well as a standalone knowledge base tool or with other SaaS platforms.
Oracle’s Collaboration capabilities (7/10) offer essential tools for knowledge sharing, though they 
lack the depth found in platforms dedicated solely to collaboration.
A crucial aspect of Oracle’s offering is its Technical Performance & Innovation (8/10), underscor-

The ROI and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (5/10) for Oracle Knowledge Management reﬂect

The Knowledge Authoring (5/10) capabilities of this platform are notably constrained, focusing 
primarily on text-based content while lacking native support for broader content formats such as audio 
and video and lacking any external app integrations. This limitation narrows its utility to mainly text-
based articles for customer service and self-help applications.
Salesforce’s Einstein AI (6/10) allows organizations to create insights across the entire Salesforce Suite, 
bringing intelligent enhancements to the search and discovery experience (8/10). The Salesforce plat-
form’s Administrative (6/10) features offer robust article management and customization options but 
fall short regarding record management and data migration.
Collaboration (7/10) within Salesforce Knowledge beneﬁts from Salesforce’s Chatter and shared work-
spaces, though deeper integration with external tools could amplify its collaborative potential. The plat-
form’s integration (8/10) strengths lie within the Salesforce ecosystem, facilitating seamless knowledge 
access and management but extending less effectively beyond it without additional APIs and third-par-
ty integrations.
Salesforce’s commitment to security and compliance (9/10) with global standards like GDPR and HIPAA 
earns high marks, ensuring user data protection and adherence to legal data security requirements. 
However, its technical performance (7/10), while beneﬁting from Salesforce’s scalable architecture and 
AI enhancements, needs to improve in integration with external products.
The lower ROI and TCO score (5/10) for Salesforce Knowledge underscores this. At the same time the 
platform has the potential to enhance productivity within a centralized business task management 
framework. However, achieving maximum ROI requires signiﬁcant customization and integration ef-
forts, which ultimately will cost more money. The subscription-based pricing model offers scalability 
but also reﬂects the costs related to customization, integration, and ongoing support.
With a score of 6.9 out of 10, Salesforce Knowledge’s robust features are designed to improve customer 
service and operational efﬁciency, balanced against the challenges and required investments to exploit

Introduction to 
Knowledge 
Management
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
It has evolved beyond a multidisciplinary approach to delivering and managing an en-
terprise’s knowledge and information assets to become a strategic enabler of organiza-
tional innovation and efﬁciency. This evolution is driven by technological advancements 
and changing organizational needs, positioning KM as a catalyst for fostering a culture 
that prioritizes knowledge sharing and collective intelligence. Current trends show a 
signiﬁcant shift towards integrating enterprise search capabilities and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence (AI) into KM practices. This integration facilitates a seamless search experience 
and personalized content delivery, enhancing decision-making and problem-solving.
The intersection of knowledge management, enterprise search, and AI represents a 
new frontier in managing organizational knowledge. When combined with KM strat-
egies, AI technologies empower organizations to automate content categorization, 
improve search accuracy, and generate actionable insights from vast data pools. The 
synergy between AI and KM platforms transforms traditional information repositories 
into dynamic, intelligent systems that anticipate user needs and facilitate real-time 
knowledge sharing.
A cornerstone for organizational success in the rapidly evolving digital landscape char-
acteristic of modern businesses. The discipline of knowledge management spans de-
cades and was designed to manage an organization’s knowledge assets systematically. 
It aims to create value and meet strategic business requirements by fostering a culture 
of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This introduction sets the foundation for 
understanding the breadth and depth of knowledge management and its critical role in 
shaping organizational strategies and outcomes with knowledge management plat-
form solutions.
Types of Knowledge
Recognizing the different types of knowledge is crucial in any effective knowledge management program. 
Knowledge within organizations can generally be categorized into three main types: tacit, implicit, and 
explicit.
Tacit Knowledge
 is personal knowledge 
embedded in individual 
experience. It involves intangible 
factors such as personal beliefs, 
perspectives, and value systems. 
Tacit knowledge is challenging 
to articulate and often shared 
through direct person-to-
person interaction and personal 
relationships.
Implicit Knowledge 
(sometimes considered a subset 
of tacit knowledge) refers to 
knowledge that has not yet 
been documented but can be 
articulated and captured with 
effort. It includes routines, 
practices, and procedures that 
employees are often unaware 
they possess until they are asked 
to share or describe them.
Explicit Knowledge 
is knowledge that has been or 
can be articulated, codiﬁed, 
and stored in certain media. It 
is easily transmitted to others 
and includes policies, procedural 
guides, reports, and documents.
Incorporating knowledge management strategies that capture all three types creates better outcomes 
because it establishes a culture where organizational learning can ﬂourish. Guiding how knowledge is 
captured, shared, and utilized across the organization is critical to success.
The Purpose and Beneﬁts of 
Knowledge Management
The primary purpose of knowledge management is to harness the collective expertise and 
information within an organization, making it accessible to the right people at the right 
time using the best knowledge management system. By leveraging strategic knowledge 
management strategies together with the best knowledge management tools, businesses can:
1. Enhance decision-making capabilities
2. Accelerate innovation and responsiveness 
3. Improve customer service and satisfaction
4. Increase efﬁciency and reduce information silos
5. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among employees
6. Optimize operational efﬁciencies
7. Strengthen data security and compliance
The effectiveness of these strategies often hinges on deploying a robust Knowledge 
Management System (KMS), which serves as the technological backbone for achieving these 
beneﬁts. A well-implemented KMS supports the capture and dissemination of knowledge 
and ensures the integrity and security of information, making it an indispensable tool for 
organizations aiming to maintain a competitive edge.
What 
does a 
knowledge 
manager 
do?
The speciﬁc tasks of an organization’s Knowledge Manager will depend on the size, needs, and capabilities 
of that organization. For example, some Knowledge Managers will manage large teams while others will be a 
one-person department. Generally speaking, Knowledge Managers work cross-functionally with departments 
and teams to establish company knowledge, improve its functionality, establish metrics for its use, encourage 
the creation and access of company knowledge, and more. While the daily tasks of a Knowledge Manager may 
differ, there are some key Knowledge Manager skills that can help you succeed in any setting. Below are our 
top three.
1. Promoting Knowledge Sharing In Appealing Ways
Successful Knowledge Manager skills show, rather than just tell, why knowledge management and knowledge 
sharing tools will beneﬁt teams and employees. One of their key responsibilities is to drive awareness and 
adoption of knowledge processes and systems. It is not enough to say “these are the protocols” or even “look 
at these wonderful tools we have at our disposal.”
Take the time to learn which teams respond best to which communication channels, such as email, face-to-
face, team meetings, instant messaging, notes, alerts within the knowledge management tool, or even phone 
calls. Then make sure you’re providing information and encouragement through that channel in an eye-catch-
ing, easy to understand, and helpful way. By practicing these communication habits, a Knowledge Manager 
can have a direct impact on improving business outcomes through knowledge management adoption.
2. Facilitating Project Review To Create New Company Knowledge
Good Knowledge Managers will take a hands-on approach to developing new company knowledge. For ex-
ample, after the completion of a project or campaign, the Knowledge Manager could facilitate a review of the 
lessons learned, good and bad, from the initiative and record their ﬁndings in their knowledge management 
system. This information will help future campaign iterations or similar projects be more productive. The 
Knowledge Manager should ensure this new knowledge is easy to ﬁnd and  access within the organization’s 
knowledge management tool.
3. Personally Connecting With Stakeholders On Knowledge Needs
There are essential soft tactics for Knowledge Managers that display their Knowledge Manager skills well. They
need the interpersonal ability to connect with a variety of individuals and teams to understand what those key
stakeholders need from their knowledge management system and how they can be an asset to the knowledge
management strategy. The Knowledge Manager should feel comfortable connecting with these stakeholders,
particularly project leaders. This will allow them to expand an organization’s knowledge offerings and also work
with leaders to strategically determine what company knowledge may beneﬁt them on a project or campaign.
Some Knowledge Manager skills may not come naturally, but they can be learned. Knowledge Managers who 
develop these habits will be a great asset to any organization’s knowledge management strategy and overall 
success.
As a Knowledge Manager, take the time to understand the habits, needs, and preferences of your stakeholders. 
This will allow you to communicate more effectively, actively participate in the creation of company knowledge, 
and employ knowledge management strategies that have a real impact on your company’s success.
A Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a technology-
based solution designed to facilitate the capture, 
organization, sharing, and analysis of information within 
an organization. This system enables businesses to leverage 
their collective knowledge by making it easily accessible to 
employees, enhancing decision-making, and fostering innovation. 
By consolidating data from various sources—documents, video, images, and more—a KMS creates a centralized 
repository where knowledge is categorized, stored, and retrieved efﬁciently. An effective KMS supports 
collaboration and knowledge exchange among employees, encouraging a culture where information is stored 
and actively used to drive organizational success. Beyond just data storage, a KMS incorporates tools for 
content creation, workﬂow management, and social collaboration, making it a pivotal platform for knowledge-
driven processes and strategic decision-making.
The top KMS platforms evaluated in this report are Bloomﬁre, Conﬂuence, Document360, eGain, Guru, 
Helpjuice, MarketLogic, Microsoft Sharepoint with Copilot, Oracle, and Salesforce Knowledge 
Each platform has merits for different knowledge needs, and selecting the right platform for your company and 
knowledge goals are essential to the success of your knowledge management program.

Building a Knowledge Management Strategy
Developing an effective knowledge management strategy involves understanding your organi-
zation’s objectives, the knowledge needed to attain these objectives, and how this knowledge 
should be managed and disseminated with knowledge management software solutions. The 
right KM software solution to dissminate organizational knowledge and expertise is essental 
for sustained knowledge managment success.  The key components include:
Encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Identifying and cataloging knowledge assets (peforming a knowledge audit)
Establishing the approach to achitect knowledge assets for ease of use and 
accessibility 
Establishing governance and processes to maintain knowledge quality
Idenﬁying and implementing the right knowledge management software 
platform that aligns with the KM strategy
The journey to effective knowledge management begins with a solid foundation. This critical 
ﬁrst step involves a comprehensive assessment of your organization’s current state of knowl-
edge – understanding what information you have, where it resides, and how it is accessed and 
used. A crucial part of this process is identifying your business’ speciﬁc knowledge needs and 
the gaps in your current knowledge management system. It’s about pinpointing where your 
knowledge assets fall short and creating a plan to bridge these gaps.
To gain a holistic view, you should involve various organizational stakeholders in this initial 
phase. This collaborative approach ensures that your knowledge management strategy is 
inclusive and aligns with your organization’s diverse needs and functions. Whether streamlin-
ing decision-making, enhancing employee collaboration, or improving customer engagement, 
understanding these goals is paramount. With this insight, you can begin to chart a course 
for along the knowledge implementation roadmap that addresses your immediate needs and 
positions your organization for future growth and adaptability, leveraging a KMS to transform 
these plans into actionable strategies.

Breaking down silos and creating a culture of knowledge sharing across departments, regions and busi-
ness units is not easy. But with the correct tools and a well developed knowledge sharing strategy, it can 
unlock incredibly powerful productivity gains. When selecting a knowledge mangement platform, consider 
the role that knowledge sharing will play in achieving your goals.
One differentiating feature that a knowledge sharing platform has is a Q&A collective knowledge engine. 
This tool allows users from across the company (or customers, if the platform is external-facing) to post 
questions and get published responses from subject matter experts. Questions and answers are deep 
indexed within the knowledge sharing platform, which means that other users can search for them using 
keywords and avoid asking the same question. Over time, companies can build up a thorough collection of 
questions and answers.
Many knowledge sharing platforms also allow users across all levels of an organization to share content 
and comment on posts (depending on the permissions established by their administrators). This helps 
democratize knowledge across companies: all employees have an opportunity to provide input and share 
their expertise, regardless of department or seniority. For example, new hires might comment on training 
materials, telling leadership what they think worked well and what was unclear. Leadership could then use 
this feedback to make improvements to their onboarding process.
As you begin your search for a knowledge management solution, think about your company’s goals for the 
solution. If you’re just looking for a simple repository to publish answers to common questions, building 
or buying a traditional knowledge base may be enough. However, if your company has a high volume of 
content that employees need to be able to search quickly, and if you want employees or customers to en-
gage with company content and contribute their own knowledge, you should be searching for a knowledge 
sharing platform.

as well as the security and integrity of its content, carried the highest weight because 
these two factors are foundational to a KM solution. 
Comprehensive Analysis of
Knowledge Management
Software Platforms
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing 
the knowledge and information of an organization. 
Software Platforms that solve the technological challenges of knowledge management  
and organizational practices must support all aspects of identifying, capturing, 
evaluating, retrieving, and sharing an enterprise’s information assets.
When considering the individual attributes of knowledge management systems, each platform has been 
independently evaluated against the criteria. This analysis purposefully selected platforms that support 
the entire knowledge management lifecycle, from knowledge creation, sharing, and integration with other 
business tools. Generative AI promises to disrupt the traditional knowledge management system market; 
however, early analysis of LLMs connected to enterprise search tools has shown mixed results in maintaining 
secure access to conﬁdential information and referencing incomplete, outdated, or redundant content to 
inform the model. Knowledge management software with curated and certiﬁed sources of knowledge can 
provide more accurate, secure, and reliable responses via generative AI. The convergence of these tools – 
generative AI, enterprise search, and knowledge management platforms will be a trend to watch in 2024 and 
2025.
Enterprises looking to leverage artiﬁcial intelligence to improve their knowledge management practices must 
consider all of the appropriate criteria applicable to their unique business practices. In addition to the 12 crite-
ria identiﬁed here, adopting ethical AI practices is crucial to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability 
in managing and utilizing knowledge. AI ethics is a collection of moral principles, processes, and techniques 
intended to advise and direct the development and responsible use of artiﬁcial intelligence technology.
Why Were These Knowledge Management Software Vendors Chosen for the Review?
The KM software solutions being evaluated were selected because they address a range of organizational 
needs, from general internal knowledge management and collaboration to specialized customer support 
and external-facing knowledge bases. However, knowledge management (KM) software solutions reveal 
several core features typical across various platforms, underscoring the essential elements required for ef-
fective knowledge management in organizations. Firstly, a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork 
is evident, with most solutions offering shared workspaces, real-time editing, and communication tools. This 
functionality is crucial in fostering a collaborative environment and ensuring that teams collaborate seam-
lessly on knowledge creation and sharing. Integration capabilities are another fundamental commonality, 
with these knowledge management tools often designed to integrate seamlessly with other systems such as 
CRM, ERP, AI, search, ontology management, and various productivity tools. Such integrations are vital for 
creating a cohesive workﬂow and efﬁcient transfer of information across different organizational platforms.
Furthermore, customization and ﬂexibility are prominent features, enabling organizations to tailor the 
knowledge management software to their needs and processes. This includes options for custom tem-
plates, layouts, and conﬁgurable user interfaces, allowing organizations to adapt the tool to their unique 
requirements and preferences. Content creation and management capabilities are central to all these solu-
tions, providing robust tools for creating, editing, organizing, and storing diverse knowledge formats. Along-
side this, effective search and discovery features, often powered by AI and semantic search technologies, 
are a staple, facilitating quick and relevant information retrieval.
Managing user access and permissions is a universal feature essential for maintaining data security and 
regulatory compliance. This is complemented by analytics and reporting capabilities, which offer insights 
into knowledge management system usage and help identify areas for improvement. I found that most (not 
all) of these tools are designed to support internal knowledge management and external customer-facing 
knowledge bases, providing dual functionality to manage comprehensive organizational knowledge needs. 
Scalability is a critical aspect that these vendors emphasize, ensuring that the knowledge management 
system can grow with the organization. 
Interestingly, while all vendors stress ease of use and intuitive interface design, this varies across
