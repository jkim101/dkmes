Introduction 
 
 
This is a knowledge management book covering the theories, frameworks, 
models, tools, and supporting disciplines that are relevant to both the student and 
the practitioner. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of 
knowledge management by examining its objectives, scope, strategy, best 
practices, knowledge management tools, and so on. The book is structured very 
much like a textbook, with introductory concepts at the top, more subject-specific 
discussions in the latter half.

Introducing Knowledge 
Management 
 
  

 
11 
Knowledge management is essentially 
about getting the right knowledge to the 
right person at the right time. This in itself 
may not seem so complex, but it implies a 
strong tie to corporate strategy, 
understanding of where and in what forms 
knowledge exists, creating processes that 
span organizational functions, and ensuring 
that initiatives are accepted and supported 
by organizational members. Knowledge 
management may also include new 
knowledge creation, or it may solely focu s 
on knowledge sharing, storage, and 
refinement. For a more comprehensive 
discussion and definition, see my knowledge management definition. 
It is important to remember that knowledge management is not about 
managing knowledge for knowledge's sake. The overall objective is to create value 
and leverage and refine the firm's knowledge assets to meet organizational goals. 
Implementing knowledge management thus has several dimensions including: 
Strategy: Knowledge management strategy must be dependent on corporate 
strategy. The objective is to manage, share, and create relevant knowledge assets 
that will help meet tactical and strategic requirements. 
Organizational Culture:  The organizational culture influences the way people 
interact, the context within which knowledge is created, the resistance they will 
have towards certain changes, and ultimately the way they share (or the way they 
do not share) knowledge. 
Organizational Processes: The right processes, environments, and systems that 
enable KM to be implemented in the organization. 
Management & Leadership:  KM requires competent and experienced 
leadership at all levels. There are a wide variety of KM-related roles that an 
organization may or may not need to implement, including a CKO, knowledge 

 
12 
managers, knowledge brokers and so on. More on this in the section on KM 
positions and roles. 
Technology: The systems, tools, and technologies that fit the organization's 
requirements - properly designed and implemented. 
Politics: The long-term support to implement and sustain initiatives that involve 
virtually all organizational functions, which may be costly to implement (both from 
the perspective of time and money), and which often do not have a directly visible 
return on investment. 
In the past, failed initiatives were often due to an excessive focus on primitive 
knowledge management tools and systems, at the expense of other areas. While it 
is still true that KM is about people and human interaction, KM systems have come 
a long way and have evolved from being an optional part of KM to a critical 
component. Today, such systems can allow for the capture of unstructured 
thoughts and ideas, can create virtual conferencing allowing close contact 
between people from different parts of the world, and so on. This issue will also be 
addressed throughout the site, and particularly in the knowledge management 
strategy section. 
At this point, the articles presented on this site focus on the first five 
dimensions. For now, at least, the political dimension is beyond the scope of this 
site. 
Throughout the site, I will explain and discuss known theories, occasionally 
contributing with some of my own frameworks. I will also discuss the potential role 
of knowledge management systems from a broad perspective, and in the section 
on KM tools I will provide specific advice on this topic. I have tried to organize the 
site as logically as possible, moving from a general introduction to knowledge and 
KM to introducing key subjects like organizational memory, learning, and culture. 
The later sections discuss several models and frameworks as well as knowledge 
management initiatives, strategy, and systems, before finally presenting an 
overview of various tools and techniques.

Knowledge, 
Information and Data 
  

 
14 
Defining Knowledge, Information, Data 
Before one can begin to talk about knowledge management (KM), one must 
start by clearly defining the meaning of the word "knowledge". It is important to 
understand what constitutes knowledge and what falls under the category of 
information or data. Unfortunately, this is a more difficult task than may be 
apparent at first. Within everyday language, within specific fields, and even within 
the same disciplines, the word "knowledge" often takes on a variety of meanings. 
Perspectives on Knowledge, Information, Data 
In everyday language we use knowledge all the time. Sometimes we mean 
know-how, while other times we are talking about wisdom. On many occasions we 
even use it to refer to information. Part of the difficulty of defining knowledge 
arises from its relationship to two other concepts, namely data and information. 
These two terms are often regarded as lower denominations of knowledge, but 
the exact relationship varies greatly from one example to another. 
Within more technologically oriented disciplines- particularly involving 
information systems- knowledge is often treated very similarly to information. It is 
seen as something one can codify and transmit, and where IT plays a pivotal role in 
knowledge sharing. For instance, the encyclopedia at fact-archive.com defines it 
as: "information that has a purpose or use." 
This kind of simplistic view of knowledge was particularly widespread during the 
90s when information technology became increasingly more common. However 
even today, some KM systems are little more than information management 
systems using knowledge as a virtual synonym for information. 
To illustrate, Theirauf (1999) defines the three components as follows: data is 
the lowest point, an unstructured collection of facts and figures; information is the 
next level, and it is regarded as structured data; finally, knowledge is defined as 
"information about information". 
However, increasingly one sees definitions that treat knowledge as a more 
complex and personal concept that incorporate more than just information. The 
 
15 
Longman online dictionary has one definition that begins to approach the way that 
knowledge is usually regarded within KM. It states "the information, skills, and 
understanding that you have gained through learning or experience." Although still 
closely associated with information, concepts like skills, understanding, and 
experience begin to surface. 
Defining Data, Information, and Knowledge 
Here, I have included the definitions that will be used throughout this book. 
Data: Facts and figures which relay something specific, but which are not 
organized in any way and which provide no further information regarding patterns, 
context, etc. I will use the definition for data presented by Thierauf (1999): 
"unstructured facts and figures that have the least impact on the typical manager." 
Information: For data to become information, it must be contextualized, 
categorized, calculated and condensed (Davenport & Prusak 2000). Information 
thus paints a bigger picture; it is data with relevance and purpose (Bali et al 2009). 
It may convey a trend in the environment, or perhaps indicate a pattern of sales 

 
16 
for a given period of time. Essentially information is found "in answers to 
questions that begin with such words as who, what, where, when, and how many" 
(Ackoff 1999). 
IT is usually invaluable in the capacity of turning data into information, 
particularly in larger firms that generate large amounts of data across multiple 
departments and functions. The human brain is mainly needed to assist in 
contextualization. 
Knowledge: Knowledge is closely linked to doing and implies know-how and 
understanding. The knowledge possessed by each individual is a product of his 
experience and encompasses the norms by which he evaluates new inputs from 
his surroundings (Davenport & Prusak 2000). I will use the definition presented by 
Gamble and Blackwell (2001), based closely on a previous definition by Davenport 
& Prusak: 
"Knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, 
expert insight, and grounded intuition that provides an environment and 
framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It 
originates and is applied in the mind of the knowers. In organizations it often 
becomes embedded not only in documents or repositories, but also in 
organizational routines, practices and norms." 
In order for KM to succeed, one needs a deep understanding of what constitutes 
knowledge. Now that we have set clear boundaries between knowledge, 
information, and data, it is possible to go one step further and look at the forms in 
which knowledge exists and the different ways that it can be accessed, shared, and 
combined. I will discuss this in the section titled "The Different Kinds of 
Knowledge". 
  
 
17 
 
The Different Types of Knowledge 
Understanding the different forms that knowledge can exist in, and thereby 
being able to distinguish between various types of knowledge, is an essential step 
for knowledge management (KM). For example, it should be fairly evident that the 
knowledge captured in a document would need to be managed (i.e. stored, 
retrieved, shared, changed, etc.) in a totally different way than that gathered over 
the years by an expert craftsman. 
Over the centuries many attempts have been made to classify knowledge, and 
different fields have focused on different dimensions. This has resulted in 
numerous classifications and distinctions based in philosophy and even religion. 
Though not directly related to our purpose here, the Wikipedia article on 
knowledge provides some interesting background reading (go to article). 
Within business and KM, two types of knowledge are usually defined, namely 
explicit and tacit knowledge. The former refers to codified knowledge, such as that 
found in documents, while the latter refers to non-codified and often 
personal/experience-based knowledge. 
KM and organizational learning theory almost always take root in the interaction 
and relationship between these two types of knowledge. This concept has been 
introduced and developed by Nonaka in the 90's (e.g. Nonaka 1994) and remains a 
theoretical cornerstone of this discipline. Botha et al (2008) point out that tacit 
and explicit knowledge should be seen as a spectrum rather than as definitive 
points. Therefore, in practice, all knowledge is a mixture of tacit and explicit 
elements rather than being one or the other. However, in order to understand 
knowledge, it is important to define these theoretical opposites. 
Some researchers make a further distinction and talk of embedded knowledge. 
This way, one differentiates between knowledge embodied in people and that 
embedded in processes, organizational culture, routines, etc. (Horvath 2000). 
Gamble and Blackwell (2001) use a scale consisting of represented-embodied-
embedded knowledge, where the first two closely match the explicit-tacit. 
 
18 
Without question, the most important distinction within KM is between explicit 
and tacit knowledge. However, I find that the embedded dimension is a valuable 
addition, since the managerial requirements for this type of knowledge are quite 
different. For this reason, the discussions on this site will, when relevant, use all 
three categorizations of knowledge but the focus will always be primarily on the 
explicit-tacit dimension. 
Below I present an overview of these three categories, as well as a short 
discussion on the way knowledge management systems (KMS) can/cannot be used 
to manage them. 
Explicit Knowledge 
This type of knowledge is formalized and codified and is sometimes referred to 
as know-what (Brown & Duguid 1998). It is therefore fairly easy to identify, store, 
and retrieve (Wellman 2009). This is the type of knowledge most easily handled b y 
KMS, which are very effective at facilitating the storage, retrieval, and modification 
of documents and texts. 
From a managerial perspective, the greatest challenge with explicit knowledge is 
similar to information. It involves ensuring that people have access to what they 
need; that important knowledge is stored; and that the knowledge is reviewed, 
updated, or discarded. 
Many theoreticians regard explicit knowledge as being less important (e.g. 
Brown & Duguid 1991, Cook & Brown 1999, Bukowitz & Williams 1999, etc.). It  is 
considered simpler in nature and cannot contain the rich experience-based know-
how that can generate lasting competitive advantage. 
Although this is changing to some limited degree, KM initiatives driven by 
technology have often had the flaw of focusing almost exclusively on this type of 
knowledge. As discussed previously, in fields such as IT there is often a lack of a 
more sophisticated definition. This has therefore created many products labeled 
as KM systems, which in actual fact are/were nothing more than information and 
explicit knowledge management software. 
Explicit knowledge is found in: databases, memos, notes, documents, etc. (Botha 
et al. 2008) 
 
19 
Tacit Knowledge 
This type of knowledge was originally defined by Polanyi in 1966. It is sometimes 
referred to as know-how (Brown & Duguid 1998) and refers to intuitive, hard to 
define knowledge that is largely experience based. Because of this, tacit 
knowledge is often context dependent and personal in nature. It is hard to 
communicate and deeply rooted in action, commitment, and involvement (Nonaka 
1994). 
Tacit knowledge is also regarded as being the most valuable source of 
knowledge, and the most likely to lead to breakthroughs in the organization 
(Wellman 2009). Gamble & Blackwell (2001) link the lack of focus on tacit 
knowledge directly to the reduced capability for innovation and sustained 
competitiveness. 
KMS have a very hard time handling this type of knowledge. An IT system relies 
on codification, which is something that is difficult/impossible for the tacit 
knowledge holder. 
 
20 
Using a reference by Polanyi (1966), imagine trying to write an article that would 
accurately convey how one reads facial expressions. It should be quite apparent 
that it would be near impossible to convey our intuitive understanding gathered 
from years of experience and practice. Virtually all practitioners rely on this type of 
knowledge. An IT specialist for example will troubleshoot a problem based on his 
experience and intuition. It would be very difficult for him to codify his knowledge 
into a document that could convey his know-how to a beginner. This is one reason 
why experience in a particular field is so highly regarded in the job market. 
The exact extent to which IT systems can aid in the transfer and enhancement of 
tacit knowledge is a rather complicated discussion. For now, suffice it to say that 
successful KM initiatives must place a very strong emphasis on the tacit dimension, 
focusing on the people and processes involved, and using IT in a supporting role. 
Tacit knowledge is found in: the minds of human stakeholders. It includes 
cultural beliefs, values, attitudes, mental models, etc. as well as skills, capabilities 
and expertise (Botha et al 2008). On this site, I will generally limit tacit knowledge 

 
21 
to knowledge embodied in people and refer separately to embedded knowledge 
(as defined below), whenever making this distinction is relevant. 
Embedded Knowledge 
Embedded knowledge refers to the knowledge that is locked in processes, 
products, culture, routines, artifacts, or structures (Horvath 2000, Gamble & 
Blackwell 2001). Knowledge is embedded either formally, such as through a 
management initiative to formalize a certain beneficial routine, or informally as 
the organization uses and applies the other two knowledge types. 
The challenges in managing embedded knowledge vary considerably and will 
often differ from embodied tacit knowledge. Culture and routines can be both 
difficult to understand and hard to change. Formalized routines on the other hand 
may be easier to implement and management can actively try to embed the fruits 
of lessons learned directly into procedures, routines, and products. 
IT's role in this context is somewhat limited but it does have some useful 
applications. Broadly speaking, IT can be used to help map organizational 
knowledge areas; as a tool in reverse engineering of products (thus trying to 
uncover hidden embedded knowledge); or as a supporting mechanism for 
processes and cultures. However, it has also been argued that IT can have a 
disruptive influence on culture and processes, particularly if implemented 
improperly. 
Due to the difficulty in effectively managing embedded knowledge, firms that 
succeed may enjoy a significant competitive advantage. 
Embedded knowledge is found in: rules, processes, manuals, organizational 
culture, codes of conduct, ethics, products, etc. It is important to note, that while 
embedded knowledge can exist in explicit sources (i.e. a rule can be written in a 
manual), the knowledge itself is not explicit, i.e. it is not immediately apparent 
why doing something this way is beneficial to the organization. 
 
22 
 
 
What is Knowledge 
Management? 
  

 
23 
The full scope of knowledge management (KM) is not something that is 
universally accepted. However, before one looks at the differences in the 
definitions, let's the similarities. 
KM is about making the right knowledge available to the right people. It is about 
making sure that an organization can learn, and that it will be able to retrieve and 
use its knowledge assets in current applications as they are needed. In the words 
of Peter Drucker it is "the coordination and exploitation of organizational 
knowledge resources, in order to create benefit and competitive advantage" 
(Drucker 1999). 
Where the disagreement sometimes occurs is in conjunction with the creation of 
new knowledge. Wellman (2009) limits the scope of KM to lessons learned and the 
techniques employed for the management of what is already known. He argues 
that knowledge creation is often perceived as a separate discipline and generally 
falls under innovation management. 
Bukowitz and Williams (1999) link KM directly to tactical and strategic 
requirements. Its focus is on the use and enhancement of knowledge-based assets 
to enable the firm to respond to these issues. According to this view, the answer 
to the question "what is knowledge management" would be significantly broader. 
A similarly broad definition is presented by Davenport & Prusak (2000), which 
states that KM "is managing the corporation's knowledge through a systematically 
and organizationally specified process for acquiring, organizing, sustaining, 
applying, sharing and renewing both the tacit and explicit knowledge of employees 
to enhance organizational performance and create value." 
I will also choose to answer the question "what is knowledge management" in 
the broader perspective, encompassing not just the exploitation and management 
of existing knowledge assets, but the also the initiatives involved in the creation 
and acquisition of new knowledge. In the next article, I will arrive at a specific 
knowledge management definition. 
  
 
24 
Knowledge Management Definition 
 
Based on the discussion in the previous section, my knowledge management 
definition is as follows: 
Knowledge management is the systematic management of an organization's 
knowledge assets for the purpose of creating value and meeting tactical & 
strategic requirements; it consists of the initiatives, processes, strategies, and 
systems that sustain and enhance the storage, assessment, sharing, refinement, 
and creation of knowledge. 
Knowledge management (KM) therefore implies a strong tie to organizational 
goals and strategy, and it involves the management of knowledge that is useful for 
some purpose and which creates value for the organization. 
Expanding upon the previous knowledge management definition, KM involves 
the understanding of: 
Where and in what forms knowledge exists; what the organization needs to 
know; how to promote a culture conducive to learning, sharing, and knowledge 
creation; how to make the right knowledge available to the right people at the 
right time; how to best generate or acquire new relevant knowledge; how to 
manage all of these factors so as to enhance performance in light of the 
organization's strategic goals and short-term opportunities and threats. 
KM must therefore create/provide the right tools, people, knowledge, structures 
(teams, etc.), culture, etc. so as to enhance learning; it must understand the value 
and applications of the new knowledge created; it must store this knowledge and 
make it readily available for the right people at the right time; and it must 
continuously assess, apply, refine, and remove organizational knowledge in 
conjunction with concrete long and short-term factors. 
From this knowledge management definition, we can see that it depends upon 
the management of the organization's knowledge creation and conversion 
mechanisms; organizational memory and retrieval facilities; organizational 
 
25 
learning; and organizational culture. These concepts will be explored in more 
detail in the following sections. 
  
 
26 
Why is Knowledge Management Useful? 
 
I have been asked to write this piece by someone who was not entirely familiar 
with the knowledge management (KM) discipline. Looking back at the work I 
presented on this site, I can see how a beginner, and particularly a manager new 
to the subject, might not easily understand why knowledge management is useful 
for their particular situation. 
I will keep this concise and to the point. Knowledge management is responsible 
for understanding: 
● What your organization knows. 
● Where this knowledge is located, e.g. in the mind of a specific expert, a 
specific department, in old files, with a specific team, etc. 
● In what form this knowledge is stored e.g. the minds of experts, on paper, 
etc. 
● How to best transfer this knowledge to relevant people, so as to be able to 
take advantage of it or to ensure that it is not lost. E.g. setting up a 
mentoring relationship between experienced experts and new employees, 
implementing a document management system to provide access to key 
explicit knowledge. 
● The need to methodically assess the organization's actual know-how vs the 
organization's needs and to act accordingly, e.g. by hiring or firing, by 
promoting specific in-house knowledge creation, etc. 
So, why is knowledge management useful? It is useful because it places a focus 
on knowledge as an actual asset, rather than as something intangible. In so doing, 
it enables the firm to better protect and exploit what it knows, and to improve and 
focus its knowledge development efforts to match its needs. 
In other words: 
● It helps firms learn from past mistakes and successes. 
● It better exploits existing knowledge assets by re-deploying them in areas 
where the firm stands to gain something, e.g. using knowledge from one 
 
27 
department to improve or create a product in another department, 
modifying knowledge from a past process to create a new solution, etc. 
● It promotes a long-term focus on developing the right competencies and 
skills and removing obsolete knowledge. 
● It enhances the firm's ability to innovate. 
● It enhances the firm's ability to protect its key knowledge and 
competencies from being lost or copied. 
Unfortunately, KM is an area in which companies are often reluctant to invest 
because it can be expensive to implement properly, and it is extremely difficult to 
determine a specific ROI. Moreover, KM is a concept the definition of which is not 
universally accepted, and for example within IT one often sees a much shallower, 
information-oriented approach. Particularly in the early days, this has led to many 
"KM" failures and these have tarnished the reputation of the subject as a whole. 
Sadly, even today, probably about one in three blogs that I read on this subject 
have absolutely nothing to do with the KM that I was taught back in business 
school. I will discuss this latter issue in greater detail in the future. 
discuss this latter issue in greater detail in the future. 
  
 
28 
Information Management vs Knowledge Management 
 
This has always been a bit of a tricky subject, because knowledge and 
information are used interchangeably by so many people. Therefore, you will often 
find KM solutions even today which are essentially nothing more than information 
or document management systems, i.e. which handle data, information, or 
perhaps even explicit knowledge, but which do not touch the most essential part 
of KM - tacit knowledge. 
Below you can find an infographic of the main differences, with a short 
explanation below. Please keep in mind that IM in many ways is a useful tool for 
KM, in that information can help create and refine knowledge, but as a discipline it 
is a different one. 
 

 
29 
 
 
As I showed in the previous sections, knowledge and information are actually 
quite different, as is tacit and explicit knowledge. So, while information and data 
management are certainly very useful, particularly as information sources are 
growing at exponential rates and with the new focus on big data, it is not 
synonymous with KM. 
So, what exactly is the difference? 
Information and IM: 
● Focus on data and information 
● Deal with unstructured and structured facts and figures. 
● Benefit greatly from technology, since the information being conveyed is 
already codified and in an easily transferrable form. 
● Focus on organizing, analyzing, and retrieving - again due to the codified 
nature of the information. 
● Is largely about know-what, i.e. it offers a fact that you can then use to 
help create useful knowledge, but in itself that 
● fact does not convey a course of action (e.g. sales of product x are up 25% 
last quarter). 
● Is easy to copy - due to its codified and easily transferrable nature. 
Knowledge and KM: 
● Focus on knowledge, understanding, and wisdom 
● Deal with both codified and uncodified knowledge. Uncodified knowledge - 
the most valuable type of knowledge - is found in the minds of 
practitioners and is unarticulated, context-based, and experience-based. 
● Technology is extremely useful, but KM's focus is on people and processes. 
IT is great for transferring explicit, codified knowledge, but it's role in the 
transfer of deeper, internalized knowledge is more complex. Since this kind 
of knowledge is passed from person to person, through interaction, 
collaboration, mentoring, etc. and preferably in an unstructured 
 
30 
environment, IT tools for KM have to support this function. They are 
therefore not merely passing on information, but also act as tools to bring 
people together, to enhance communication, to allow the storage and 
transfer of unstructured thoughts and notes, etc. 
● Focus on locating, understanding, enabling, and encouraging - by creating 
environments, cultures, processes, etc. where knowledge is shared and 
created. 
● Is largely about know-how, know-why, and know-who 
● Is hard to copy - at least regarding the tacit elements. The connection to 
experience and context makes tacit knowledge extremely difficult to copy. 
This is why universities cannot produce seasoned practitioners - there are 
some things (the most important things) that you simply cannot teach 
from a textbook (or other codified source of information/explicit 
knowledge). These are learnt in the field and understood on an intuitive 
level. You cannot easily copy or even understand this intuition without the 
right experience, context, etc. - and it is this intuition that represents the 
most valuable organizational knowledge.

Introducing Organizational Knowledge 
 
In an earlier section we identified the three different types of knowledge that 
can exist in an organization. Now I will take a closer look at the scope 
organizational knowledge and its significance to the knowledge management (KM) 
process. 
Organizational Knowledge Resources 
Business knowledge can exist on several different levels: 
Individual: Personal, often tacit knowledge/know-how of some sort. It can also 
be explicit, but it must be individual in nature, e.g. a private notebook. 
Groups/community: Knowledge held in groups but not shared with the rest of 
the organization. Companies usually consist of communities (most often informally 
created) which are linked together by common practice. These communities of 
practice (Lave & Wenger 1991) may share common values, language, procedures, 
know-how, etc. They are a source of learning and a repository for tacit, explicit, 
and embedded knowledge. 
Structural: Embedded knowledge found in processes, culture, etc. This may be 
understood by many or very few members of the organization. E.g. the knowledge 
embedded in the routines used by the army may not be known by the soldiers 
who follow these routines. At times, structural knowledge may be the remnant of 
past, otherwise long forgotten lessons, where the knowledge of this lesson exists 
exclusively in the process itself. 
Organizational: The definition of organizational knowledge is yet another 
concept that has very little consensus within literature. Variations include the 
extent to which the knowledge is spread within the organization, as well as the 
actual make-up of this knowledge. Hatch (2010) defines it as: "When group 
knowledge from several subunits or groups is combined and used to create new 
 
33 
knowledge, the resulting tacit and explicit knowledge can be called organizational 
knowledge." 
Others present a broader perspective: "individual knowledge, shared 
knowledge, and objectified knowledge are different aspects or views of 
organizational knowledge" (Ekinge & Lennartsson 2000). As always, texts 
emphasizing an IT based outlook once again offer shallower, information-based 
definitions, e.g. Virvou & Nakamura 2008, "Information internalized by means of 
research, study or experience that has value to the organization". 
For the purpose of this site I will adopt a broad, knowledge-based perspective. 
Organizational knowledge is therefore defined as: all the knowledge resources 
within an organization that can be realistically tapped by that organization.  It can 
therefore reside in individuals and groups or exist at the organizational level. 
Extra-organizational: Defined here as: Knowledge resources existing outside the 
organization which could be used to enhance the performance of the organization. 
They include explicit elements like publications, as well as tacit elements found in 
communities of practice that span beyond the organization's borders. 
Implications for KM 
In order to enhance organizational knowledge, KM must therefore be involved 
across the entire knowledge spectrum. It must help knowledge development at all 
levels and facilitate & promote its diffusion to individuals, groups, and/or across 
the entire firm, in accordance with the organization's requirements. KM must 
manage organizational knowledge storage and retrieval capabilities and create an 
environment conducive to learning and knowledge sharing. Similarly, it must be 
involved in tapping external sources of knowledge whenever these are necessary 
for the development of the organizational knowledge resources. 
To a large degree, KM is therefore dependent on the understanding and 
management of organizational learning, organizational memory, knowledge 
sharing, knowledge creation, and organizational culture. 
  
 
34 
The SECI Model and Knowledge Conversion 
 
Arguably the most important contributor to this subject has been Ikujiro 
Nonaka. He worked extensively with the concepts of explicit knowledge and tacit 
knowledge and drew attention to the way Western firms tend to focus too much 
on the former (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1996). This sentiment has since been echoed 
throughout organisational learning and knowledge management (KM) literature 
(e.g. Cook & Brown 1999, Kreiner 1999, Tsoukas & Valdimirou 2001, etc.). 
Nonaka and Takeuchi introduced the SECI model (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1996) 
which has become the cornerstone of knowledge creation and transfer theory. 
They proposed four ways that knowledge types can be combined and converted, 
showing how knowledge is shared and created in the organization. The model is 
based on the two types of knowledge outlined above. 
Socialization: Tacit to tacit. Knowledge is passed on through practice, guidance, 
imitation, and observation. 
Externalization: Tacit to explicit. This is deemed as a particularly difficult and 
often particularly important conversion mechanism. Tacit knowledge is codified 
into documents, manuals, etc. so that it can spread more easily through the 
organization. Since tacit knowledge can be virtually impossible to codify, the 
extent of this knowledge conversion mechanism is debatable. The use of metaphor 
is cited as an important externalization mechanism. 
Combination: Explicit to explicit. This is the simplest form. Codified knowledge 
sources (e.g. documents) are combined to create new knowledge. 
Internalization: Explicit to tacit. As explicit sources are used and learned, the 
knowledge is internalized, modifying the user's existing tacit knowledge. 
The SECI Model Knowledge Creation Spiral 
In this model, knowledge is continuously converted and created as users 
practice, collaborate, interact, and learn. The process should be seen as a 
continuous, dynamic, swirl of knowledge rather than a static model. It is basically a 
 
35 
visual representation of overlapping, continuous processes that take place - or 
should take place - in an organization. 
 
Below I have included a graphical representation of this concept as presented in 
the SECI model: 
 
A great deal of effort has been put into investigating its practical applicability (with mixed results), but 
in recent years the appl icability of the model has been linked strongly to culture, both organizational 
and national. The issue is whether culture is more than just an element in a KM model, i.e. culture- in-
the-model, but rather acts as a limiting factor for a model, i.e. culture-of- the-model (Andreeva & 
Ikhilchik 2011). The issue of culture as a limiting factor for KM models is an issue I will incorporate 
into the site in the future and provide a link from this article to the new sections. 
Nonetheless, the SECI model remains at t he core of knowledge conversion theory within KM, and this 
almost universal attraction to the model may in itself be an indication that some aspects of it appeal to 
virtually all cultures (Andreeva & Ikhilchik 2011). 

 
36 
  
 
37 
Organizational Memory and Knowledge Repositories 
 
Traditional memory is associated with the individual's ability to acquire, retain, 
and retrieve knowledge. Within business this concept is extended beyond the 
individual, and organizational memory therefore refers to the collective ability to 
store and retrieve knowledge and information. 
So how does one define organizational memory? Any definition would need to 
span all the different repositories in which a company may store knowledge. This 
includes the more formal records, as well as tacit and embedded knowledge 
located in people, organizational culture, and processes. 
Walsh and Ungson (1991) offer some deeper insight into the workings of 
organizational memory. They look at how and organization's history can influence 
current decision making. They how shared understandings evolve, becoming part 
of an organizational whole which may remain constant even after key individuals 
have left the firm. This is done through the formation of collective interpretations 
regarding the outcome of decision making. The information defining the decision's 
stimulus and response is stored in information, and it affects present decisions 
when it is retrieved. 
Walsh and Ungson (1991) define a number of stages in the organizational 
memory process and outline five retention facilities: 
● Acquisition: Organizational memory consists of the accumulated 
information regarding past decisions. This information is not centrally 
stored, but rather it is split across different retention facilities. Each time a 
decision is made, and the consequences are evaluated, some information 
is added to the organizational memory. 
● Retention: Past experiences can be retained in any of the five different 
repositories: 
o Individuals 
o Culture: The language and frameworks that exist within an organization 
and form shared interpretations. 
 
38 
o Transformations: The procedures and formalized systems that the 
organization employs. These systems reflect the firm's past experiences 
and are repositories for embedded knowledge. 
o Structures: These link the individual to other individuals and to the 
environment. Social interaction is conditioned by mutual expectations 
between individuals based on their roles within the organization. The 
interaction sequences for a pattern over time and begin to extend to an 
organizational level. This can take place both through formal and informal 
structure and it constitutes a social memory which stores information 
about an organization's perception of the environment. 
o External activities: The surroundings of the organization where knowledge 
and information can be stored. E.g. former employees, government bodies, 
competitors, etc. 
● Retrieval: This can either be controlled or automatic. The latter refers to 
the intuitive and essentially effortless process of accessing organizational 
memory, usually as part of an established sequence of action. Controlled 
refers to the deliberate attempt to access stored knowledge. 
As one can see, the three stages presented here are essential to the learning 
process of the firm. Much like an individual, the firm must be able to access and 
use past experiences so as to avoid repeating mistakes and to exploit valuable 
knowledge. Unlike an individual however, OM is not centrally stored and resides 
throughout the firm and even beyond it. The process of retrieving 
knowledge/information will inevitably vary depending on the retention facility that 
one is trying to access. For example, written documentation may be accessed 
through IT while cultural memory is accessed through the understanding and/or 
application of the norms and procedures of the working environment. 
A further distinction regarding the type of knowledge retained in the organization 
is offered by Ramage and Reif (1996). They separate the documented aspects from 
the subtler knowledge that belongs to individuals as a result of their role as 
members of the organization: 
● Artifacts of Cooperation: These are the hard indicators which are visible 
and examinable. They include products, records of collaboration, and 
ideas. The latter refers to minutes of meetings, reports, FAQs, and other 
 
39 
items that record common knowledge. These are easily storable and 
presumably also more easily accessible. 
● Knowledge of the Organization Qua Entity: This type of knowledge cannot 
be stored in the same way as the artifacts of cooperation. It includes 
knowledge of the political system, of the culture, and of how things are 
normally done within the firm. It can include the knowledge of who is an 
expert, of where a particular person is, and on who to contact for a specific 
problem. 
This definition is useful as a way of understanding the knowledge categories and 
the potential management challenge that organizational memory, and ultimately 
knowledge management (KM) would pose. 
Furthermore, as is the case with many KM related disciplines, one finds a distinct 
difference in the way organizational memory is perceived between IT practitioners 
and business theoreticians. In the words of Wellman (2009): "The IT path 
emphasizes the acquisition and storage of organizational knowledge including data 
warehousing, document management, and search tools. The organization 
development (OD) path emphasizes tacit knowledge, coaching, social interactions, 
and encouraging ad hoc knowledge exchange." 
IT based models thus tend to focus on more concrete, definable memory and less 
on people, culture, and informal structures. Essentially, they focus more on 
artifacts of cooperation. 
Since this site deals with organizational memory within the context of KM, it is not 
necessary to arrive at a specific definition or model. Instead it is important to 
understand the scope of organizational memory, its varied and often complex 
retention facilities, and the types of knowledge available. In later sections, I will 
investigate more closely the specific role that IT can have in supporting, 
promoting, and enhancing organizational memory.

Introducing Organizational Learning 
 
What is Organizational Learning? 
Learning is the way we create new knowledge and improve ourselves. Although 
there is ample debate regarding the mechanisms and scope of learning, in its 
simplest form this is no different for organizations. Botha et al. describe the 
organizational learning process as follows: 
 
 
As one can see organizational learning is based on applying knowledge for a 
purpose and learning from the process and from the outcome. Brown and Duguid 
(1991) describe organizational learning as "the bridge between working and 
innovating." This once again links learning to action, but it also implies useful 
improvement. 
The implications to knowledge management are three-fold: 

 
43 
 
● One must understand how to create the ideal organizational learning 
environment 
● One must be aware of how and why something has been learned. 
● One must try to ensure that the learning that takes place is useful to the 
organization 
Organizational Learning Pitfalls 
Senge (1990) argues that often it is failure that provides the richest learning 
experience, which is something that organizations need to understand and use 
more effectively. He criticizes the way we reward success and look down upon 
failure as something that can be detrimental to the long-term health of the 
organization. Levitt and March (1996) further argue that success is ambiguous and 
depends on how it is interpreted. This interpretation may not only vary 
significantly between different groups within the organization but may change 
over time as success indicators and levels of aspiration change. 
Levitt and March (1996) also discuss superstitious learning. This occurs when 
positive or negative results are associated with the wrong actions. Success and 
failure can both generate superstitious learning. If a firm does well, the routines 
that they followed are linked to this success and are subsequently reinforced. The 
opposite is true for failure. In such cases, the organization thinks that it has 
learned when in fact it has not. Real organizational learning would have resulted 
from the examination of the information generated from their actions rather than 
from relatively arbitrary success or failure criteria. 
Different Approaches to Organizational Learning 
Generally speaking, there are two approaches to organizational learning. Th e 
first view looks at the firm as a whole and s learning from a cognitive perspective. 
In a way, the firm is treated like a large brain composed of the individual members 
of the organization. The second view looks at learning as community based, where 
the firm's practitioners create knowledge in their own networks called 
communities of practice (Lave & Wenger 1991). 
 
44 
These views should be seen as complementary rather than contradictory. The 
next two sub-sections will organizational learning theory from these two 
perspectives. 
  
 
45 
Organizational Learning Theory: Company 
Perspective 
 
Two of the most noteworthy contributors to the field of organizational learning 
theory have been Chris Argrys and Donald Schon. Organizational learning (OL), 
according to Argrys & Schon is a product of organizational inquiry. This means that 
whenever expected outcome differs from actual outcome, an individual (or group) 
will engage in inquiry to understand and, if necessary, solve this inconsistency. In 
the process of organizational inquiry, the individual will interact with other 
members of the organization and learning will take place. Learning is therefore a 
direct product of this interaction. 
Argrys and Schon emphasize that this interaction often goes well beyond 
defined organizational rules and procedures. Their approach to organizational 
learning theory is based on the understanding of two (often conflicting) modes of 
operation: 
 

 
46 
 
Espoused theory : This refers to the formalized part of the organization. Every 
firm will tend to have various instructions regarding the way employees should 
conduct themselves in order to carry out their jobs (e.g. problem solving). These 
instructions are often specific and narrow in focus, confining the individual to a set 
path. An example of espoused theory might be "if the computer does not work, try 
rebooting it and then contact the IT department." 
Theory-in-use: This is the actual way things are done. Individuals will rarely 
follow espoused theory and will rely on interaction and brainstorming to solve a 
problem. Theory in use refers to the loose, flowing, and social way that employees 
solve problems and learn. An example of this might be the way someone actually 
solves a problem with their computer by troubleshooting solutions, researching on 
forums, asking co-workers for opinions, etc. 
The fact that there is a mismatch between these two approaches is potentially 
problematic if the company enforces its espoused theory. In order to create an 
environment conducive to learning, firms are encouraged to accept theory in use, 
and make it easy for the individual to interact with his working environment in an 
undefined and unstructured way. Essentially, they should provide the right 
environment for organizational inquiry to take place, unconstrained by formal 
procedures. 
Levitt and March (1996) expand further on the dynamics of organizational 
learning theory. Their view presents the organization as routine-based, history 
dependent, and target oriented. While lessons from history are stored in the 
organizational memory, the event itself is often lost. They note that past lessons 
are captured by routines "in a way that makes the lessons, but not the history, 
accessible to organizations and organizational members." The problem most 
organizations face is that it is usually better to have the event rather than the 
interpretation. However, this is often too costly (both financially and time-wise) to 
be feasible. 
OL is transmitted through socialization, education, imitation and so on, and can 
change over time as a result of interpretations of history. 
 
47 
Organizational Learning Theory: The Three Types of Learning 
Argrys and Schon (1996) identify three levels of learning which may be present 
in the organization: 
 
● Single loop learning:  Consists of one feedback loop when strategy is 
modified in response to an unexpected result (error correction). E.g. when 
sales are down, marketing managers inquire into the cause, and tweak the 
strategy to try to bring sales back on track. 
● Double loop learning:  Learning that results in a change in theory- in-use. 
The values, strategies, and assumptions that govern action are changed to 
create a more efficient environment. In the above example, managers 
might rethink the entire marketing or sales process so that there will be no 
(or fewer) such fluctuations in the future. 
● Deuterolearning: Learning about improving the learning system itself. This 
is composed of structural and behavioral components which determine 
how learning takes place. Essentially deuterolearning is therefore "learning 
how to learn." 
This can be closely linked to Senge's concept of the learning organization, 
particularly in regard to improving learning processes and 
understanding/modifying mental models. 
Effective learning must therefore include all three, continuously improving the 
organization at all levels. However, while any organization will employ single loop 
learning, double loop and particularly deuterolearning are a far greater challenge. 
Conclusion 
From organizational learning theory we can infer the following issues which may 
affect knowledge management and knowledge management systems: 

 
48 
● OL is dependent on allowing organizational inquiry to take place according 
to theory-in-use, not espoused theory. 
● OL is a complex mechanism, resulting often in the storage of 
interpretations of past events, rather than the events themselves. 
● OL can take place on three different levels. While single loop learning 
comes natural to any individual/organization, special attention must be 
paid to the double-loop and deuterolearning 
  
 
49 
Organizational Learning and Communities of Practice 
 
What are Communities of Practice? 
Communities of practice is a term originally developed by Lave and Wenger 
(1991). It describes a learning theory with a strong relationship to the social 
construction of knowledge. The community of practice (sometimes incorrectly 
referred to as "communities of practices") consists of members who interact with 
each other for their pursuit of a common practice. It is therefore this collective 
social practice that links individuals together across official organizational 
boundaries and departments and makes up the community. 
It is important to note that these are not teams. A community of practice can be 
defined as "a group of professionals informally bound to one another through 
exposure to a common class of problems, common pursuit of solutions, and 
thereby themselves embodying a store of knowledge" (Stewart 2001 in Botha et al 
2008). 
For further reading and a very detailed overview on the workings and 
composition of communities of practice, see this article by Etienne Wenger (one of 
the founders of the term). 
Learning Within Communities of Practice 
Learning is seen as deriving from the social process of becoming a practitioner, 
as it gives the individual a social context of being an integrated part of a 
community. The social construction of identity shapes each person's view and 
interpretation of the world. Learning and the creation of new knowledge can then 
take place within the context dependent forum of the community and can be 
shared through social practice. 
Lave and Wenger (1991) introduce the concept of legitimate peripheral learning 
(LPP). LPP links learning to participation within a community of practice. Th e 
objective is not to acquire any specific knowledge, but instead to be granted 
access to the community and its culture and language. As a newcomer learns the 
 
50 
formal and informal culture and values of the community, he becomes a legitimate 
member. Essentially, he moves form peripheral to full participation. 
Brown and Duguid (1991) further investigate organizational learning from a 
community perspective. They refer to canonical and non-canonical practice- which 
are concepts similar to espoused theory and theory- in-use described in the 
previous section. Canonical practice refers to adherence to formal rules and 
procedures, while non-canonical refers to the informal routines that dominate day 
to day procedures. Brown and Duguid warn against strict canonical focus as it 
inhibits the problem-solving capabilities of the organization. They stress that it is 
unstructured dialogue, particularly through storytelling, that leads to innovation 
and problem solving. 
Storytelling functions as a wisdom repository and is instrumental in the creation 
of new knowledge. This is closely linked to Levitt and March's concept of history 
dependent learning where the interpretations of events (rather than the actual 
events) are remembered and passed on. It is also somewhat reminiscent of 
Nonaka's externalization process, when tacit knowledge is made explicit often 
through the use of metaphor. 
Garfield (2018) presents a number of principles concerning communities in 
organizations, including: 
● They must be independent of organizational structure. 
● They are not teams, sites, blogs, etc.; they are people who interact, and 
they are based on topics. 
● Community membership cannot be forced; it must be voluntary. 
● Communities should span organizational, functional and geographic 
boundaries. 
● Communities require a "critical mass" of members. 
● Communities must be nurtured. 
The Implications to KM 
Botha et al (2008) summarize the key factors regarding communities of practice 
as follows: 
● Learning is a social phenomenon 
 
51 
● Knowledge is integrated into the culture, values, and language of the 
community 
● Learning and community membership are inseparable 
● We learn by doing and therefore knowledge and practice are inseparable. 
● Empowerment is key to learning: The best learning environments are 
created when there are real consequences to the individual and his 
community of practice. 
Management must understand the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations 
of communities of practice. For example, because they are so loosely defined it 
may be very hard to identify them when a problem needs to be solved- to resolve 
this some companies today are mapping their communities of practice (Botha 
2008). Another issue could be the problem of transferring and combining 
knowledge across the firm. Due to the close ties to "doing" as well as the cultural 
elements, this may require innovative solutions- e.g. using temporary cross 
functional project teams that can leverage knowledge from different areas, apply 
it, learn, and the redistribute the new knowledge back into the individual 
members' communities. 
All this should underline the importance of recognizing and supporting 
communities of practice. Knowledge management (KM) initiatives and systems 
must therefore be supportive, non-disruptive, and must not enforce canonical 
practice.

The Significance of Organizational Culture 
 
In this article I will look at organizational culture and its impact on KM processes. 
The other article in this section s leadership and the learning organization, as 
outlined by Peter Senge. 
What is Organizational Culture? 
The social elements of knowledge that have been underlined in previous 
sections are at least partially dependent on organizational and community culture. 
Organizational culture determines values and beliefs which are an integral part of 
what one chooses to see and absorb (Davenport & Prusak 2000). It includes a 
shared perception of reality, regarding how things are and how things should be. 
Furthermore, community and group culture determine the willingness and 
conditions for knowledge sharing with other members of the organization. 
Knowledge, and knowledge sharing, are thus inseparable from organizational 
culture. 
Wellman (2009) essentially describes culture as "the way it is around here." To 
illustrate the perseverance of organizational culture he presents an interesting 
allegory which I will summarize below: 
“Put five apes in a cage. Then dangle a banana from the ceiling of that cage and 
place a ladder under it. Whenever an ape attempts to climb the ladder to reach the 
banana, spray all of them with cold water. After a few times, the apes will 
associate climbing the ladder with being sprayed with cold water. One can now 
turn off the cold water. 
Then, replace one of the original apes with a new one. This new ape will 
undoubtedly try to get to the banana, but if he tries he will be attacked by the 
others. He will have no idea why this is so but will soon learn that he must not 
climb the ladder. Next replace yet another ape. When he approaches the ladder all 
the apes will attack him. One of these apes has no idea why he may not climb the 
 
55 
ladder, but he participates in the punishment enthusiastically. Soon the new ape 
will also learn not to climb the ladder. 
 
In this way, one can continue until all the original apes are replaced. At this 
stage, none of them know why they must not climb the ladder, but none will do so, 
and all will attack anyone that tries. All of this because "that's the way it has 
always been around here." 
Strange as it may seem, this kind of cultural learning can be identified time and 
again in real world organizations. Wellman points out that at times this can be 
beneficial and detrimental. Hard wiring a reaction can push the organization into 
action quickly against a perceived threat. The problem is that this "instinctive 
response may be inappropriate for the current environment but may be triggered 
nonetheless" (Wellman 2009). 
All in all, organizational culture can be split into levels (Schein 1992): 
● Artifacts: These represent the visible elements such as processes, 
structures, goals, climate, dress codes, furniture, etc. An outsider can see 
them but may not understand why things are the way things are. 
● Espoused values: The values espoused by the leaders. They most often are 
grounded in shared assumptions (see below) of how the company should 
be run. If there is a significant mismatch between the leadership espoused 
values and this perception, the organization may be in trouble. 
● Assumptions: These are the actual values of the culture. They refer to the 
(often tacit) views of the world itself (e.g. human nature). Again, these 
assumptions should need to correlate at least to a certain degree to the 
espoused leadership values for the organization to function smoothly. 
Organizational Culture and Knowledge Sharing 
The importance of a knowledge sharing culture as an enabler for the transfer 
and creation of knowledge is directly addressed by such authors as Bukowitz & 
Williams (1999), Davenport and Prusak (2000), and Gamble and Blackwell (2001). 
In order to make knowledge management initiatives work in practice, the 
employees within the firm must be willing to share their knowledge with others. 
 
56 
Leaders must understand the culture both on an organizational and community 
level. While culture often exists on an organizational level, each community may 
have its own norms, perspectives, and collective understandings. Their willingness 
to share and to seek knowledge will be influenced by these collective views. 
 
One major influence on a culture's knowledge sharing willingness is the issue of 
reciprocity (Davenport & Prusak 2000). This refers to the individual's need to 
perceive a current or future return on the knowledge he chooses to share. This 
could be in the form of direct compensation of some kind; it could be something 
intangible like enhancing the individual's reputation; but it can also be the 
knowledge that the favor will be returned the next time he requires assistance. 
Finally, internal competition is yet another aspect of organizational culture that 
may interfere with the knowledge sharing and knowledge creation process. 
The Problems with Managing Organizational Culture 
The problems with managing culture can be summed up as follows: 
● Culture reaffirms itself by rejecting misfits and promoting those that 
adhere to the norms of the organization (Gamble & Blackwell 2001). 
● Culture often consists of learned responses that are hard wired into the 
organization. The actual events that sparked this "lesson" may be long 
forgotten (Wellman 2009). This is very similar to the concept of 
organizational learning according to Levitt and March (1996) which 
indicates that organizations are far more likely to remember 
interpretations of events rather than the event itself. 
● Culture contains falsehoods. Past lessons are applied often without 
understanding them and their reasons for being. 
All this makes organization culture extremely difficult to change and manage. 
For more on this, see the section titled corporate culture change. 
  
 
57 
Leadership and "The Learning Organization" 
 
The term "learning organization", not to be confused with organizational 
learning, was popularized by Peter Senge. It describes an organization with an 
ideal learning environment, perfectly in tune with the organization's goals. Such an 
organization is a place "where people continually expand their capacity to create 
the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are 
nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually 
learning to see the whole (reality) together." (Senge 1992). 
This subsection will focus largely on the work of Peter Senge, and it will serve as 
a basis for understanding: 
1. The ideal organizational environment for learning, knowledge 
management (KM), innovation, etc., as described through the term "the 
learning organization". 
2. The leadership qualities necessary for promoting and encouraging this 
ideal environment. 
The Learning Organization 
According to Senge, the learning organization depends upon the mastery of five 
dimensions: 
Systems thinking: The notion of treating the organization as a complex system 
composed of smaller (often complex) systems. This requires an understanding of 
the whole, as well as the components, not unlike the way a doctor should 
understand the human body. Some of the key elements here are recognizing the 
complexity of the organization and having a long-term focus. Senge advocates the 
use of system maps that show how systems connect.  
Personal mastery: Senge describes this as a process where an individual strives 
to enhance his vision and focus his energy, and to be in a constant state of 
learning.  
 
58 
Mental models:  "Deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even 
pictures and images that influence how we understand the world and how we take 
action" (Senge 1990). These must be recognized and challenged so as to allow for 
new ideas and changes.  
Building shared vision:  Shared vision is a powerful motivator. A leader's vision 
does not necessarily become shared by those below him. The key here is to pass 
on a picture of the future. To influence using dialogue, commitment, and 
enthusiasm, rather than to try to dictate. Storytelling is one possible tool that can 
be used here.  
Team learning:  The state where team members think together to achieve 
common goals. It builds on shared vision, adding the element of collaboration. 
The Role of Leadership 
Senge emphasized the role of the leader in the creation of this learning 
organization. He defined three leadership roles (1990) that would reshape the old-
fashioned approach to be the boss. These are: 
Leader as Designer: Senge likens this to be the designer of a ship rather than its 
captain. He defined it in three ways: 
● Creating a common vision with shared values and purpose. 
● Determining the "policies, strategies, and structures that translate guiding 
ideas into business decisions." 
● Creating effective learning processes which will allow for continuous 
improvement of the policies, strategies, and structures. 
Leader as Teacher:  The leader here is seen as a coach that works with the 
mental models present in the organization. He must understand the (usually tacit) 
concepts of reality and restructure these views "to see beyond the superficial 
conditions and events [and] into the underlying causes of the problems." 
Leader as Steward:  This is the vaguest of the three and refers largely to the 
attitude of the leader. He emphasizes the importance of a leader that feels he is 
part of something greater; whose desire is first and foremost not to lead, but to 
serve this greater purpose of building better organizations and reshaping the way 
businesses operate. 
 
59 
The first two roles outlined by Senge shed a lot of light into the requirements of 
effective KM and organizational learning.

Building Knowledge Management Frameworks and 
Models 
 
At this stage we have had a look at the components and definitions that related 
to knowledge management (KM). This section deals with knowledge management 
frameworks and models. The old saying that a picture paints a thousand words is 
very much applicable in this case. A good model can integrate various elements 
and show relationships in a way that is much harder to do in writing. 
But first, what are the components of a knowledge management framework? At 
the most basic level, KM consists of the following steps: 
● Identification of needs 
● Identification of knowledge resources 
● Acquisition, creation, or elimination of knowledge related 
resources/processes/environments 
● Retrieval, application and sharing of knowledge 
● Storage of knowledge 
It is important to note that none of these processes are independent and all of 
them are affected by countless factors. This is why knowledge management 
frameworks are typically very different and can be presented in a wide variety of 
ways. 
For instance, some models are sequential (as above), and seek to provide a 
better overview at the expense of "realism". Other models display overlapping 
processes in an attempt to simulate what actually occurs inside an organization. 
The problem with the latter is that they are often hard to grasp and can only 
convey limited information so as not to become incomprehensible. In the 
following section I will provide examples of both. 
Since KM is closely related or dependent on other disciplines (such as strategy, 
information management, project management, etc.) and it is enabled by a wide 
range of processes and systems, a model can become very complex indeed. 
 
63 
This is why there is no such thing as an integrated and fully detailed knowledge 
management framework, i.e. one that captures all relevant aspects with 
appropriate detail. Each model must choose its focus and origin, as well as its 
limitations. 
There are essentially three questions that a knowledge management framework 
may choose to answer: 
● What/How 
● Why 
● When 
"What/how" refers to the actual processes of knowledge management. 
"Why" refers to an indication of the reasons behind using one method or the 
other. 
"When" refers to the timing for using one method or another and is very closely 
related to "why". 
The latter two questions are usually tackled in more strategic oriented models 
that take a broader perspective. What/how is usually dealt with in process-
oriented models that focus on an understanding of the tools available to the 
manager. These kinds of models are generally more common particularly since the 
role of knowledge management can be defined far more narrowly than I have 
chosen to do on this site. 
In the following section I will a few solid KM models dealing with all the aspects I 
have discussed above. However, before I conclude, I will present a very useful 
framework outlined by Botha et al (2008) titled the "knowledge management 
broad categories". 
You don´t know 
 
Knowledge Discovery Explore, research, create 
You know Knowledge Repository 
(Knowledge Base) 
Knowledge sharing and 
transfer 
 Knowledge you have Knowledge you don’t 
have 
 
64 
Here, one can see the role of knowledge management from a broad perspective 
(very similar to the one adopted on this site), i.e. which includes more than just 
knowledge sharing/access/etc, but also new knowledge creation. These categories 
provide a solid overview of the components of any knowledge management 
framework focusing on the what/how question. 
  
 
65 
Three Knowledge Management Models 
 
In this section I will explain three knowledge management (KM) models that 
take three very different approaches to KM. 
The KM Process Framework by Bukowitz and Williams (1999) 
 
This KM model depicts the process that defines the strategy for management to 
build, divest, and enhance knowledge assets. It is a model that emphasizes the 
"why" and "when" aspects. The strengths of this model rest on its strategic focus, 
which essentially puts knowledge management action into context. It is also worth 

 
66 
noting that the notion of "divestment" is included - something which is often 
missing from KM models. 
 
KM initiatives are the result of the response to tactical and strategic changes and 
needs. The model provides a great overview of the strategy behind KM but it does 
not include any deeper insight into what initiatives are suitable in a given instance. 
The KM Matrix by Gamble and Blackwell (2001) 
This KM model presents a general theoretical framework, as well as specific 
guidelines for implementation. 
The KM process is split into four stages. First management must locate the 
sources of knowledge. Then they must organize this knowledge so as to assess the 
firm's strengths and weaknesses and determine its relevance and reusability. This 
is followed by socialization, where various techniques are used to help share and 

 
67 
disseminate it to whomever needs it in the organization. Finally, the knowledge is 
internalized through use. 
As all sequential models, the steps are not to be taken literally, but they do 
provide an excellent overview of the role of the KM manager. However, one 
limitation of this model is its focus. First of all, the overall strategic role outline by 
Bukowitz and Williams is not included. Secondly, KM's role here is limited to 
knowledge sharing, omitting the processes of knowledge acquisition/creation and 
divestment. This is a perfectly legitimate approach to KM where the focus is on the 
sharing and retrieval of existing knowledge, but it does not fulfill the scope of the 
knowledge management definition outlined on this site. 
 
68 
The Knowledge Management Process Model by Botha et al (2008) 
This model attempts to offer a more realistic overview of the KM process. The 
three broad categories overlap and interact with one another. Like Gamble & 
Blackwell, the focus is on managerial initiatives. Here too the strategic focus (the 
"when" and the "why" as opposed to the "what") is omitted. It is noteworthy that 
this model does include the creation of new knowledge as a specific KM initiative. 
The model further shows which of the three categories are more people 
oriented and which are more technology focused. Whether or not knowledge 
sharing should be largely technology focused is certainly debatable and it is 
something that I will address in future sections. However, for better or for worse, 
this is largely how organizations tend to approach the issue i.e. as a technological 
rather than organizational and social challenge. 
We have now looked at three models that take very different approaches to KM. 
There is one other important aspect relating to KM that has not been directly dealt 

 
69 
with by these models. I am referring now to the measurement of effects that lets 
management know whether the implemented initiatives are achieving the desired 
results. This is dependent upon data and information management but is 
paramount for future KM initiatives. 
Based on these models, as well as on the topics discussed on this site so far, I 
will present my version of an integrated knowledge management model. 
  
 
70 
My Integrated Model 
 
The integrated knowledge management model that I have created combines the 
main aspects of the topics discussed on this site into a model that focuses on the 
strategic perspective. The integrated knowledge management model attempts to 
link both process and strategy, while offering specific initiatives at different stages. 
The model also outlines the relationship of information and information 
management systems to knowledge management (KM). 

 
71 
 
The integrated knowledge management model draws upon elements presented 
by Bukowitz & Williams, Gamble & Blackwell, Botha et al, and Nonaka & Takeuchi. 
It also includes the concept of organizational memory as defined earlier. 
The dark gray elements represent KM initiatives, the yellow boxes represent 
corporate strategy, while the teal boxes depict data and information systems and 
repositories. The process is initiated from the tactical and strategic considerations, 
illustrating the way KM strategy goes hand in hand with corporate strategy. The 
non-bolded elements in the gray oval indicate the knowledge related processes 
that go on within the organization as it operates, and which management 
affects/enhances through its initiatives. 
● Detect & Discover: Search for existing knowledge as well as hidden 
knowledge within information and data. 
● Organize & Assess: Organization and assessment of knowledge assets. 
Knowledge is categorized, evaluated, and made easier to access (by 
providing maps etc.). 
● KM Tactical initiatives: 
o Act - Reuse: If the firm can use existing knowledge to meet a tactical 
opportunity or threat, the role of KM is to identify this knowledge and 
enable it to be used. This means that if it is required by a different 
person/group, then KM is responsible for making it available to all 
relevant parties. 
o Knowledge reuse thus combines the previous points on detection and 
organization with a new aspect: knowledge sharing. 
o Act - Create/acquire: If the right knowledge resources do not exist, the 
firm may create or acquire them, assuming the right processes and 
systems are in place to support this. For example, the knowledge may 
be acquired from partners if the right relationships are in place. 
knowledge creation depends on the right internal environments that 
allow for combination and conversion of knowledge assets. 
o Failure to act: This is not really a KM initiative in itself, but it does have 
some implications. In the event that a firm fails to act there is still a 
lesson to be learned. Management must evaluate if this is something 
 
72 
that needs to be addressed in the future. This decision is fed back into 
the loop, affecting future strategic choices. 
● KM Strategic Initiatives: 
o Invest: Support or implement. Here I refer to the organizational 
structures, culture, knowledge retention, competencies, external 
network, and systems that direct, affect, and/or enable the KM 
initiatives discussed above in the long term. Strategic initiatives may, for 
example, involve creating a knowledge sharing culture, restructuring the 
firm, establishing a beneficial partnership, or implementing a new IT 
system. If the right environment, system, etc. is already in place, 
management must make sure to continuously support it. It is important 
to note that some of these do not fall solely within KM, and they are all 
fields of study in their own right. However, in this case, we are 
interested solely in the way these broader strategic initiatives shape the 
focus and direction of KM in the long term. 
o Divest: When knowledge assets become obsolete they need to be 
removed. KM is responsible for maintaining relevant knowledge assets. 
The differentiation between tactical and strategic initiatives should not be seen 
as categorical, and in reality, projects and initiatives will often have mixed goals. 
The integrated knowledge management model itself should be seen as 
continuously looping, with new or modified knowledge and information being fed 
into organizational memory and information repositories each time. 
All processes are thus supported by information systems. They play an 
important role in tracking progress and feeding that information back into the 
system. This way, each time the integrated knowledge management model is run, 
it is based on different information, understanding, knowledge, and circumstances 
than the last time. As with all sequential models, none of this should be taken 
absolutely literally. 
Although this is called an "integrated" knowledge management model, it is not 
intended to be all-encompassing. Since KM is such a broad discipline, one could 
continue to add elements until the model was so complex that it had no meaning. 
 
73 
Conclusion 
In this section and the preceding ones, I have looked at various KM models and 
presented my version of an integrated knowledge management model. 
Although not intended to represent all possible areas, the integrated knowledge 
management model does cover the major requirements of a model as defined 
earlier. To recap, these are: 
● Identification of needs 
● Identification of knowledge resources 
● Acquisition, creation, or elimination of knowledge related 
resources/processes/environments 
● Retrieval, application and sharing of knowledge 
● Storage of knowledge 
It also addresses (at least to some degree) the 3 main approaches to knowledge 
management, also outlined in earlier sections, namely: what/how, why, when. 
Finally, the model ties in information, strategy, and organizational memory, 
building on the work of past authors. 
The following section will knowledge management processes and knowledge 
management strategy in-depth. The section will be modelled after the categories 
presented in this integrated knowledge management model.

Introduction Knowledge Management Processes  
 
This section will deal with the actual knowledge management processes. So far, I 
have presented an introduction to knowledge management as well as several 
frameworks. Now it is time to talk about the different processes and initiatives. 
This section, as well as the subsequent one on knowledge management strategy, 
will be structured according to the layout of the integrated knowledge 
management model presented earlier. 
Under the initiative referred to as "act", the integrated model outlines a series 
of knowledge management processes. They will be used as headings for the 
subsections presented here and can be accessed through the menu on the left. 
These are: 
● Knowledge Discovery & Detection 
● Knowledge Organization & Assessment 
● Knowledge Sharing 
● Knowledge Reuse 
● Knowledge Creation 
● Knowledge Acquisition 
These form the backbone of knowledge management processes as they outline 
all aspects involved in the actual management of knowledge. 
At the end of the section on knowledge management strategy, a subsection 
titled knowledge management best practices will summarize all the aspects 
discussed thus far. 
  
 
77 
Knowledge Discovery and Detection 
 
In this subsection, I will the knowledge management (KM) initiatives involved in 
knowledge discovery & detection. 
This step deals with discovering the knowledge that a firm possesses all over the 
organization, as well as the patterns in the information available that hide 
previously undetected pockets of knowledge. 
Once knowledge is created, it exists within the organization. However, before it 
can be reused or shared it must be properly recognized and categorized. This 
subsection deals with the former aspect, while the following subsection deals with 
the latter. 
● Explicit Knowledge: This is largely a process of sorting through documents 
and other records, as well as discovering knowledge within existing data 
and knowledge repositories. For the latter, IT can be used to uncover 
hidden knowledge by looking at patterns and relationships within data and 
text. The main tools/practices in this case include intelligence gathering, 
data mining (finding patterns in large bodies of data and information), and 
text mining (text analysis to search for knowledge, insights, etc.). 
Intelligence gathering is closely linked to expert systems (Bali et al 2009) 
where the system tries to capture the knowledge of an expert, though the 
extent to which they are competent for this task is questionable (Botha et 
al 2008). 
● Tacit knowledge: Discovering and detecting tacit knowledge is a lot more 
complex and often it is up to the management in each firm to gain an 
understanding of what their company's experts actually know. Since tacit 
knowledge is considered as the most valuable in relation to sustained 
competitive advantage, this is a crucial step, a step that often simply 
involves observation and awareness. There are several qualitative and 
quantitative tools/practices that can help in the process; these include 
knowledge surveys, questionnaires, individual interviews, group 
interviews, focus groups, network analysis, and observation. IT can be used 
 
78 
to help identify experts and communities. Groupware systems and other 
social/professional networks as well as expert finders can point to people 
who are considered experts and may also give an indication of the 
knowledge these people/groups possess. 
● Embedded knowledge: This implies an examination and identification of 
the knowledge trapped inside organizational routines, processes, products 
etc., which has not already been made explicit. Management must 
essentially ask "why do we do something a certain way?" This type of 
knowledge discovery involves observation and analysis, and the use of 
reverse engineering and modeling tools. 
It is important to note that the sources of knowledge that a firm has access to 
may extend well outside the organization. This type of knowledge, which was 
introduced in the previous subsection on "Understanding Organizational 
Knowledge" is called extra-organizational knowledge. This can exist in both formal 
and informal settings. The former refers to management driven initiatives like 
partnerships, while the latter refers to the informal networks of individual 
members. We are interested in the former, which can be located and managed at 
least to some degree. Gamble and Blackwell identify several such sources: 
● Alliances 
● Suppliers 
● Customers 
At this stage, we are still only discussing knowledge discovery and detection, so 
these relationships will not be explored in detail (see knowledge acquisition and 
external knowledge networks for more). Knowledge from alliances and partners 
can exist in joint projects, shared knowledge/experts ’ operational data and so on. 
Suppliers and customers can provide product feedback, trends, developments etc. 
Within their respective limitations, similar tools as above can be used to identify 
the knowledge and/or knowledge sources. 
IT can be used in this context both as a means of feedback, communication, and 
cooperation between partners, and also as a way to gather, analyze, and "mine" 
data and information. 
 
79 
Facilitating Knowledge Discovery and Detection 
Useful to this process is the adoption of practices that make knowledge easier to 
detect. For example, teams could be asked to document aspects of their work with 
a certain language and presentation standard. Generalists could be used to help 
organize this process, as well as to document the expertise of the individual team 
members (which can be used later to promote tacit knowledge socialization). A 
rundown of how management should prepare knowledge in specific situations is 
presented in the final segment of the Knowledge Reuse subsection. 
  
 
80 
Knowledge Organization & Assessment 
 
The idea that firms should categorize their knowledge assets is not a new one 
(Horvath 2000, Bukowitz & Williams 1999). In order to determine what resources, 
they have at their disposal and to pin point strengths and weaknesses, 
management needs to organize the knowledge into something manageable. 
Knowledge organization involves activities that "classify, map, index, and 
categorize knowledge for navigation, storage, and retrieval" (Botha et al. 2008). 
Markus (2001) assigns the role of preparing, sanitizing, and organizing this 
knowledge to a "knowledge intermediary". This may be a knowledge manager, or 
it may also be the actual producer of the knowledge. The point is, that in order for 
knowledge to be shared (either for reuse in a business situation or as a tool for 
knowledge creation), it must be prepared in such a way that it can be identified, 
retrieved, and understood by the knowledge user. 
Explicit knowledge organization:  IT is generally encouraged as a means of 
organizing and retrieving (Gamble and Blackwell 2001, Botha et al 2008, etc.). IT 
based systems use taxonomies and ontologies to classify and organize knowledge 
and information (Bali et al 2009). These are categorization methods that create a 
logical, hierarchical knowledge map, allowing the user to navigate by category. 
However, taxonomies are very expensive to create (Botha et al 2008). It is relevant 
to note here that although explicit knowledge is not considered as valuable as tacit 
knowledge, due to its sheer volume, an effective method of classification and 
retrieval is often essential. Other tools include libraries and data marts (Gamble & 
Blackwell 2001). 
Tacit knowledge organization:  Use of focus groups, expertise guides, social 
network analysis, and knowledge coordinators (Gamble and Blackwell 2001 and 
Liebowitz 2009). The role of the latter is to understand in which context the tacit 
knowledge was created. Expertise locators, such as corporate yellow pages, social 
network analysis and other knowledge maps can be used to pinpoint the location 
and categorize the valuable expertise of tacit knowledge sources (a.k.a. experts). 
 
81 
They can also shed light into how widespread certain tacit knowledge is, enabling 
the firm to plan ahead for the retirement of key employees. 
 
Embedded knowledge organization:  Job/workplace design, workflow analyses 
and performance measures (Gamble & Blackwell 2001) can be used to organize 
and assess embedded knowledge. Mapping is also useful here, and knowledge 
maps outlining embedded knowledge can be formulated under the guidance of 
knowledge brokers (Horvath 2000). 
Liebowitz emphasizes the determination of how important certain knowledge is 
to the organization. The two key factors to are knowledge severity or criticality and 
knowledge availability. The more critical the knowledge and the more unavailable 
it is (e.g. if only one or a few experts exist and/or if they are near retirement age), 
the more attention this knowledge deserves. 
Knowledge organization and assessment can seem like an expensive endeavor, 
particularly since the return on investment is indirect. In other words, there is lit tle 
visible gain from meticulously classifying and organizing knowledge assets. 
However, it is an important step in the knowledge management and reuse 
process. As discussed in the subsection on knowledge detection, the organization 
can put systems in place that facilitate the detection and organization of 
knowledge. These depend on the situation within which the knowledge was 
created, and the possible recipients. A closer look at this specific aspect is 
presented in the recommendations segment of the knowledge reuse subsection. 
  
 
82 
Act: Knowledge Sharing 
 
As stated earlier, knowledge management is fundamentally about making the 
right knowledge or the right knowledge sources (including people) available to the 
right people at the right time. Knowledge sharing is therefore perhaps the single 
most important aspect in this process, since the vast majority of KM initiatives 
depend upon it. Knowledge sharing can be described as either push or pull. The 
latter is when the knowledge worker actively seeks out knowledge sources (e.g. 
library search, seeking out an expert, collaborating with a coworker etc.), while 
knowledge push is when knowledge is "pushed onto" the user (e.g. newsletters, 
unsolicited publications, etc.). 
Knowledge sharing depends on the habit and willingness of the knowledge 
worker to seek out and/or be receptive to these knowledge sources. The right 
culture, incentives, and so on must therefore be present. 
In the rest of this section I will discuss the concepts of knowledge sharing 
according to the different types of knowledge. The role of IT will also be explored 
and discussed from a general perspective. 
Explicit Knowledge and Knowledge Sharing 
Successful explicit knowledge sharing is determined by the following criteria 
(Bukowitz and Williams 1999): 
● Articulation: The ability of the user to define what he needs. 
● Awareness: Awareness of the knowledge available. The provider is 
encouraged to make use of directories, maps, corporate yellow pages, etc. 
● Access: Access to the knowledge. 
● Guidance: Knowledge managers are often considered key in the build-up of 
a knowledge sharing system (Davenport & Prusak 2000, Gamble & 
Blackwell 2001). They must help define the areas of expertise of the 
members of the firm, guide their contributions, assist users, and be 
responsible for the language used in publications and other 
 
83 
communication material. This is so as to avoid an information/knowledge 
overload. 
● Completeness: Access to both centrally managed and self-published 
knowledge. The former is often more scrutinized but takes longer to 
publish and is not as hands-on (and potentially relevant). Self-published 
information on the other hand runs the risk of not being as reliable. 
IT systems have proved extremely useful in aiding or performing many of these 
functions. 
Explicit Knowledge Sharing and IT 
IT is useful in most stages of the knowledge sharing process, and it is used for 
content management as well as data and text mining (looking for hidden 
knowledge, relationships, etc. within data and documents). 
Content management systems are used to update, distribute, tag, and otherwise 
manage content. They may include a wide range of functions, including web 
content management and document management systems (which I consider 
separately). They may be used to (based on Wikipedia entry): 
● Import and create documents and multimedia material. 
● Identify key users and their roles. 
● Assign roles and responsibilities to different instances of content 
categories or types. 
● Define workflow tasks. Content managers can be alerted when changes in 
content are made. 
● Track and manage multiple versions of content. 
● Publish content to a repository to support access. Increasingly, the 
repository is a part of the system, incorporating search and retrieval. 
Document management systems use numerous advanced indexing, searching, 
and retrieval mechanisms (e.g. using meta data or content from the actual 
document) to facilitate explicit knowledge sharing. 
To take advantage of all of these functions, it is a foregone conclusion that the 
system was chosen and implemented appropriately. This aspect is discussed in the 
section on knowledge management systems. 
 
84 
All in all, IT is a very useful tool in the management of explicit knowledge and 
information. This is not to say that humans no longer play a part. They certainly 
do, and knowledge and content managers are instrumental in ensuring that the 
knowledge is relevant, up to date, and presented correctly. 
 
 
Can Explicit Knowledge Sharing Systems Yield Competitive Advantage? 
For the actual storage and retrieval, there is very little disagreement on the 
value of IT as a means of sharing, sorting, and accessing explicit knowledge. Where 
one does find disagreement is on the value placed on this function. KM and 
organizational learning theorists have sometimes downplayed the value of explicit 
knowledge and focused largely on tacit knowledge (Brown & Duguid, Cook & 
Brown 1999). However, it has also been argued that in a world where we have an 
overflow of explicit knowledge and information, the ability to manage it, and thus 
to provide continuous streams of relevant knowledge and information, can be a 
source of competitive advantage in itself (Maier 2002, Botha et al 2008). The latter 
view appears to be gaining support, although one important point should be 
considered: explicit knowledge management systems are quite transparent and 
therefore fairly easy to replicate. This means that they cannot be the source of 
sustained long term competitive advantage (Jackson et al 2003). 
All this being said, in most cases, implementing a solid system that enables 
explicit knowledge sharing is crucial for the following reasons: 
● Not doing so would almost certainly become a source of competitive 
disadvantage (for lack of a better word). 
● They may well provide a short-term advantage, which may be extended 
through continuous improvements and new technologies. 
● With proper care, such systems will also play a limited role in the sharing of 
tacit knowledge, as will be discussed in the next section. 
 
85 
Tacit Knowledge Sharing 
Sharing tacit knowledge requires socialization. This can take many different 
forms. Davenport & Prusak (2000) outline a few relevant factors: 
● Informal networks, which involve the day to day interaction between 
people within work environments are considered very important 
● Unlike the formalized structure of the firm, these networks span functions 
and hierarchies. They are therefore difficult to identify and monitor. 
● Management should support these networks by providing the means for 
communication. Japanese firms have created talk rooms where employees 
can engage in unstructured, unmonitored discussions. A specific location is 
useful but not mandatory - this process also occurs in cafeterias etc. 
Management must simply provide the means for employees to foster 
informal networks and "trade" tacit knowledge. 
● Management must also understand the value of chaos. This refers to the 
value of unstructured work practices that encourage experimentation and 
social interaction. Within a more chaotic environment, individuals are 
given the freedom to solve problems creatively and, in so doing, must tap 
into and evolve their social networks. This is closely linked to the notion of 
theory in use vs espoused theory. The value of less structured work 
environments is also well known within innovation management. 
Codification of tacit knowledge is difficult and sometimes outright impossible. 
There will often be a resulting knowledge loss (Bukowitz and Williams 1999, 
Davenport & Prusak 2000). Often, it is much more reasonable to simply externalize 
the sources of tacit knowledge rather than the knowledge itself (Davenport & 
Prusak 2000). This means that often it is better for experts to externalize what 
they know rather than how they know it. The main role of KM then becomes 
making sure that experts can be found so that tacit knowledge can be passed on 
through practice, mentoring, and networking (socialization), and that the firm 
supports and encourages the networking that is necessary for these functions to 
occur. 
To share tacit knowledge requires a culture conducive to this type of sharing. 
Furthermore, knowledge managers (generalists that understand the types of 
 
86 
knowledge that exist in the communities) must be used to locate and translate 
knowledge elements, thus facilitating their integration into other communities. 
This endeavor is very much about people and managing organizational culture 
change. 
Tacit Knowledge Sharing and IT 
It is important for tacit sharing of knowledge to be people focused. However, 
increasingly, IT systems are becoming useful in this area as well. They can support 
interaction between people that are not in the same location and some tools are 
designed to capture unstructured thoughts and ideas. The important factor to 
remember is that tacit knowledge cannot always be made explicit (and may lose 
some of its richness in the process). Therefore, IT systems should not attempt or 
pretend that they can carry out this process, but instead act as an important 
support to existing practices. 
 
IT can be useful as a forum for externalization of tacit knowledge. For example, 
groupware systems that support brainstorming can help in the codification process 
(Botha et al 2008). Online discussion databases and forums can also be sources of 
externalized knowledge (Botha et al 2008), although the richness of this 
knowledge should be questioned. 
While IT is crucial for information management, it is important not to confuse 
information with knowledge. Using IT to move tacit knowledge is difficult since 
knowledge represents the shared understanding and the sense making that is 
deeply rooted in the social practice of the community. The focus for the successful 
sharing of tacit knowledge must be on social interaction, problem solving, 
mentoring, and teaching, and IT systems must be used to support these processes 
intelligently. 
IT's contribution to OL therefore depends on its fit to the social context of the 
communities. Technology must not be seen as the superior solution and should 
not be used to structure organizational practice (at most to supplement it). There 
is also the danger that IT may limit the participation of some members of the 
community. It may make it more difficult for individuals to become accepted 
 
87 
members of the community by limiting socialization channels. The challenge is to 
extend the reach of communication without sacrificing reciprocity in regard to 
knowledge sharing or socialization. 
During KM's boom at the turn of the century, IT-driven KM initiatives turned out 
to be a major pitfall. Today you still see a divide between technologically-centric 
views and people-oriented approaches (Bali et al 2009). Increasingly however, IT is 
being recognised for its ability to provide support to sound KM initiatives, within 
knowledge sharing, creation, etc. In different capacities, IT should be regarded as a 
critical tool (though not as the initiative itself). 
The role of IT for tacit knowledge sharing can thus be summarized as follows: 
● As an expert finder:  To locate the source of the tacit knowledge through 
systems like corporate yellow pages. 
● As providing support in the socialization of tacit knowledge:  If IT systems 
support varied, formal and informal forms of communication then they can 
help tacit knowledge sharing by supporting teams, projects, communities, 
etc. Functions like being able to attach notes to documents, or video 
conferencing can support work environments over long distances to some 
degree. It is important not to replace existing socialization functions with 
IT; instead socialization should be enhanced and extended between people 
who would otherwise be unable to participate. 
● As providing some support in the externalization of tacit knowledge:  
Through groupware applications that support the codification process, 
discussion forums etc. However, not only is this aspect limited, but 
externalization itself is only rarely feasible. 
Embedded Knowledge Sharing 
As a reminder, embedded knowledge refers to knowledge locked in products, 
processes, routines, etc. 
Embedded knowledge can be shared when the knowledge from one product or 
process is incorporated into another. Management must understand what 
knowledge is locked within those sources, and they must transfer the relevant 
 
88 
parts into a different system. To do this, Gamble and Blackwell advocate the use 
of: 
● Scenario planning:  The practice of creating a set of scenarios and 
hypothesizing how they might unfold by drawing upon the perspectives of 
experts, the firm's knowledge asserts, and so on. For more on this see here 
http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_scenario_planning.htm
l 
● After action reviews: "is a structured review or de-brief process for 
analyzing what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done 
better" (Wikipedia). 
● Management training 
Embedded knowledge could theoretically be transferred as is, simply by testing 
the effects of procedures or design features transferred from one area to another. 
However, often it will have to be made explicit, or partially explicit, at least to the 
responsible managers. This way they can hypothesize the effects that embedded 
knowledge has in a given situation and use simulation and experimentation to 
implement it in a new area. 
Beyond the knowledge mapping functions described in the subsection on 
organization and assessment, IT's use is usually more indirect. It can be used as 
support in the design of simulations, experiments, and product design, and it can 
also provide modeling tools used in reverse engineering of products. However, 
these tools are not typically considered as being knowledge management systems 
and are thus beyond the scope of this website. 
 
One direct role of IT systems is as an embedded knowledge repository where 
procedures, guidelines, etc. are stored and retrieved. If implemented properly, 
with the IT system complementing rather than disrupting existing processes an d 
culture, then it can support practices and routines, and eventually become an 
embedded knowledge artifact in its own right. 
 
89 
Conclusion 
To facilitate knowledge sharing, KM must understand the requirements of the 
users, as well as the complexities and potential problems with managing 
knowledge and knowledge sources. Very broadly speaking, management must 
therefore implement the right processes, frameworks, and systems that enable 
knowledge sharing. They must also foster a knowledge sharing culture that 
ensures that these investments are fully utilized. 
 
For explicit knowledge, seven issues have been identified that KM must 
consider, these are: articulation, awareness, access, guidance, completeness. IT 
has been identified as a key component of this type of knowledge sharing, 
facilitating and lowering the cost of the storage, access, retrieval, and variety of 
explicit knowledge. 
Tacit knowledge sharing depends on socialization and practice. KM must offer 
the means for this to take place by providing the right forums (primarily physical, 
but also virtual), supporting networks and communities, and accepting 
unstructured work environments. Generalists, known as knowledge managers, 
should be used to gain an understanding of the location of knowledge sources and 
to bridge the gaps between communities and networks. 

 
90 
In order to support the transfer of tacit knowledge, KMS must support the 
socialization functions, while at the same time not enforcing strict managerial 
practices/routines/hierarchies/etc. One of its roles is as an expert finder, and it can 
also help in the direct transfer of tacit knowledge through the support of rich and 
varied methods of communication, which preferably include informal 
communication channels. 
Embedded knowledge sharing is a process whereby embedded knowledge is 
passed on from one product, routine, or process to another. Several tools have 
been described that can help management understand the effects of embedded 
knowledge and help in its transfer. These were: scenario planning, after action 
reviews, and management training.

Act: Managing Knowledge Reuse 
 
In previous subsections, I have identified how knowledge is identified, 
organized, and shared. These issues were discussed from a broad perspective, 
relevant to both knowledge reuse and knowledge creation (as will be discussed 
later). In this subsection, I will look at the specific situations involved in knowledge 
reuse and discuss the different managerial challenges. At the end I summarize the 
findings and present recommendations. 
In this subsection I will focus primarily on the explicit and tacit knowledge 
distinctions as defined in the subsection on the different types of knowledge. 
Three Roles for Knowledge Reuse 
First, a quick overview of the knowledge reuse process, and some useful 
definitions. Markus (2001) identifies three roles in the reuse of knowledge: 
● Knowledge producer: The original creator of the knowledge 
● Knowledge intermediary:  The one who packages and prepares the 
knowledge so that it may be stored, retrieved, and shared. This may 
involve any number of functions such as indexing, categorization, 
standardizing, publishing, mapping, etc. 
● Knowledge consumer:  The person who is the recipient and user of the 
knowledge in question. 
As Markus points out, these three functions may involve different people, or 
they may all be done by the same person. e.g. knowledge reuse by a person 
accessing the documented (explicit) research of someone in a different part of the 
organization requires that the producer created the documents, that either he or 
someone else prepared them so that they may be understood and retrieved, and 
that the knowledge consumer retrieved and used it. In other words, the roles were 
filled by two or three people and the process included explicit knowledge capture 
and sharing across the organization. Alternatively, in another scenario someone 
may want to use their own documentation later on. This process involves just one 
 
92 
person in all three roles and the only function performed is capturing the 
knowledge in a way that will allow retrieval at a later point. 
I would add that for tacit knowledge, the role of intermediary could be defined 
as the expert himself - since he must present the knowledge (through practice and 
socialization) in a useable way to his student, team mates, etc. It may also fall 
upon the person who identified this expert and made it possible for others to 
reach him, e.g. if a knowledge manager creates an expert profile for publishing on 
the intranet; this way, the knowledge manager creates an explicit account of what 
the expert knows rather than promoting externalization of the knowledge itself. 
To sum up, someone has to produce the knowledge, someone has to make this 
knowledge available, and someone has to search for and use this knowledge. This 
implies not just the capability, but also the willingness to share, to search, and to 
retrieve. 
Knowledge Reuse Situations 
Fruchter and Demian (2002) identify two very general types of knowledge reuse: 
● Internal: Where the knowledge producer uses his own knowledge at some 
future point. 
● External: Where the knowledge consumer uses someone else's knowledge. 
The authors point out that the latter has a much higher failure rate for 
reasons that include the loss of contextual knowledge and information, 
and knowledge that is not properly captured due to the costs involved. A 
more detailed framework is offered by Markus (2001) who identifies four 
knowledge reuse situations. These are defined below, drawing also upon 
the work of Timbrell and Jewels (2002) who found support for Markus's 
work through their study. The recommendation segments also draw upon 
some of the issues discussed under knowledge-sharing, as well as some of 
my own insights. 
● Shared Work Producers:  People working in teams producing knowledge 
for their own reuse. They are closest in knowledge-distance. They generally 
will have a good understanding of what they need and where to find it 
(including both documents and experts). Knowledge reuse will however be 
 
93 
harder within cross functional teams. Markus also warns that the rationale 
for the decision making is often forgotten. They need knowledge about 
how/what/why it was done, what improvements could be made. 
● Shared Work Practitioners:  People who perform similar work in different 
settings (e.g. same position in different locations). Knowledge is produced 
for someone else's use. Defining the knowledge needs is usually easy, as is 
locating the right experts within the network (which is used frequently). 
Basically, they need to know how to do something or why something 
works. 
● Expertise-Seeking Novices:  People who seek out knowledge they do not 
normally work with. They are furthest in knowledge-distance. They have 
great difficulty "defining the questions, locating and judging, the quality of 
the knowledge sources, and applying the expertise." (Timbrell & Jewels 
2002). 
● Miners Secondary Knowledge:  People who try to find knowledge in work 
produced in different contexts, so as to apply it in other situations. The 
knowledge and context of the consumer may be very different to the 
producer. The main challenge here is defining the question. Often requires 
complex search algorithms which are hard to create (such as those used 
within text and data mining). 
Problems and Recommendations for Managing knowledge reuse 
In the article above, I presented several situations of knowledge re-use that have 
different advantages, disadvantages, and requirements. I also discussed some 
general issues that affect the process of reuse. 
Drawing upon the work thus far, and bringing in the knowledge sharing issues 
discussed in the previous subsection, the managerial issues regarding knowledge 
reuse can be summarized as follows: 
● Cost: The time and money necessary to organize, package, store, and 
retrieve the knowledge. This is particularly true in the cases when tacit 
knowledge is externalized into explicit knowledge such as documents. A 
great deal of cost is associated with capturing context (something that is 
often impossible) and with preparing the document for retrieval. Even with 
 
94 
IT, the latter includes categorization, summarizing, use of metadata, etc. 
Content management is also necessary to check language and 
presentation, and also to keep the repositories relevant and up to date. 
The cost associated with the re-use of tacit knowledge involves setting up 
the right circumstances for it to take place e.g. teams, mentoring, teaching, 
projects, etc., as well as the systems that support communication and 
expertise location. 
● Specific requirements of specific individuals and groups:  Presented in 
Markus's four roles above. Management must be aware of the different 
requirements and support each situation accordingly. Articles on 
knowledge reuse are still dominated by IT theories which focus largely on 
organizing, presenting, and retrieving explicit knowledge. Again, I draw the 
reader's attention to the importance of socialization and informal 
networks, which serve as the backbone of the sharing of rich tacit 
knowledge (expertise). Below I present the recommendations for each re-
use category, drawing again on the work of Markus (2001), on the 
knowledge sharing principles outlined in the previous subsection, as well 
as some of my own insights. 
● Shared work producers, recommendations:  For explicit knowledge, try to 
maintain context; pay attention to indexing, categorization, and other 
search related functions; document rationale behind the knowledge. For 
cross-functional teams assign a generalist to bring the knowledge together 
and to ensure consistency. For tacit knowledge support communication 
and informal networks (e.g. between former team members). For cross-
functional teams, use the generalist to help define non-codified tacit 
expertise with individual team members. Record this expertise together 
with the individual team roles. 
● Shared work practitioners, recommendations:  If explicit, decontextualize 
knowledge and provide all relevant information regarding indexing, 
searching, and relevance. Use knowledge push to make potential 
recipients aware of it. For tacit knowledge, create the right situations for 
socialization, e.g. teamwork, projects, informal communication, etc. Use IT 
as an expertise locater and communication support but understand its 
limitations in tacit knowledge transfer. 
 
95 
● Expertise-seeking novices, recommendations:  For explicit knowledge 
decontextualize knowledge but support recontextualization in the context 
used by the novice. For both knowledge types, try to codify the contents of 
the knowledge source e.g. by defining the content of a document or the 
knowledge of an expert. Provide awareness training. For tacit knowledge 
do as for shared work practitioners. 
● Miners Secondary Knowledge:  Record context information such as 
metadata. Provide relevant training regarding knowledge, data, and 
information repositories, as well as analysis and search techniques. 
Implement IT systems that match the needs of the consumer e.g. data 
mining and analysis tools, text mining tools, etc. 
● Willingness: Both to package knowledge on the part of the producer or to 
seek it out on the part of the consumer. This brings us back to issues like 
culture, which promote knowledge reuse and knowledge sharing. The 
cultural aspect will be dealt with in the section on organizational culture 
change. 
  
 
96 
Act: Knowledge Creation 
 
The ability to create new knowledge is often at the heart of the organization's 
competitive advantage. Sometimes this issue is not treated as part of knowledge 
management since it borders and overlaps with innovation management (Wellman 
2009). Since I chose a broader knowledge management definition, I very much 
regard it as a part of the process, and I will refer (albeit superficially) to some 
theories that pertain to innovation. 
Knowledge creation according to the Nonaka's SECI model is about continuous 
transfer, combination, and conversion of the different types of knowledge, as 
users practice, interact, and learn. Cook and Brown (1999) distinguish between 
knowledge and knowing and suggest that knowledge creation is a product of the 
interplay between them. The shift in condition between the possession of 
knowledge and the act of knowing - something that comes about through practice, 
action, and interaction- is the driving force in the creation of new knowledge. 
Furthermore, in order for this interplay to be most fruitful, it is important to 
support unstructured work environments in areas where creativity and innovation 
are important. 
Knowledge sharing, and knowledge creation thus go hand in hand. Knowledge is 
created through practice, collaboration, interaction, and education, as the 
different knowledge types are shared and converted. Beyond this, knowledge 
creation is also supported by relevant information and data which can improve 
decisions and serve as building blocks in the creation of new knowledge. 
Managing Knowledge Creation 
The role of management in the knowledge creation process is thus as follows: 
To enable and encourage knowledge sharing:  On the tactical side, as described 
in the previous subsection, management must understand where and in what 
forms knowledge exists. They must then provide the right forums for knowledge to 
be shared. For tacit knowledge this implies a particular emphasis on informal 
 
97 
communication, while for explicit knowledge this implies a focus on a variety of IT 
systems. On the strategic side (to be discussed in-depth later), management must 
create/design the right environments, processes, and systems that provide the 
means and willingness for it to take place. 
To create a suitable work environment:  This includes the notion of creating an 
interplay between knowledge and knowing. It implies offering relevant courses 
and education, but most importantly allowing new knowledge to be created 
through interaction, practice, and experimentation. Botha et al (2008) point to the 
importance of shared experiences in the knowledge creation process when dealing 
with tacit knowledge, and the need for an environment where these can be 
formed. March (1988) discusses how our cultural norms often stifle innovation and 
new knowledge creation. He advocates environments where we recognize that 
goals can be created through action, where intuition is accepted and valued, and 
where experience is nothing more than a theory. These concepts bring us back to 
the concept of theory in use (referring to work environments that do not follow 
strict, "official" rules and procedures), and the acceptance and support of 
environments that allow brainstorming, trial and error, and unstructured 
interaction. 
As an example, from innovation theory, one can refer to the practice of 
establishing teams to solve problems, unhindered by the bureaucracy that may 
exist in the firm. Peters (1988) refers to the value of chaos and the advantage of 
smaller, fast-acting teams. One common alternative is the use of cross-functional 
project teams. These are usually a group of experts from different parts of the 
organization, led by a "generalist" project leader. If these teams are allowed the 
freedom to experiment and work in an autonomous, or virtually autonomous 
environment, it can be a great catalyst for innovation and new knowledge 
creation. Then, once the task is complete, the members return to their role in the 
organization, helping to spread this knowledge back into their own community of 
practice. The project team itself can also facilitate the creation of bridges between 
communities of practice, and at times may even serve as a way to extend them. 
Variations of this concept can be seen in several places in innovation theory, 
notably in Nonaka and Takeuchi's self-organizing project teams in the hypertext 
organization. 
 
98 
To provide systems that support the work process:  These can be groupware 
systems that facilitate communication or brainstorming. However, they must not 
interfere with creative processes or communities of practice or enforce rigid 
organizational practices (espoused theory). 
 
To provide knowledge workers with timely, relevant information and data.  In 
today's fast paced environment this is virtually synonymous with the 
implementation of IT systems which can store, retrieve, organize, and present 
information and data in a helpful way.  
IT and Knowledge Creation 
The use of IT is very much the same as it is for knowledge sharing, allowing for 
some degree of support in the transfer of all knowledge types. One important 
aspect is that it must support, and not interfere with, informal collaboration. For 
example, groupware systems can be used to enhance communication between 
communities or teams, particularly if they support varied (e.g. video, audio, text - 
according to the needs of the individual firm), informal communication. 
Apart from this, IT also has an important role through information management, 
by providing access to data and information, and allowing the manager to perform 
in-depth analyses. More than that, IT systems can also be programmed to spot 
trends in data and information and present that to the manager. This essentially 
enables the manager to make better decisions and aids knowledge creation by 
providing some of the building blocks for new knowledge. 
IT tools can also be used in the innovation process (e.g. tools used in the actual 
product design), but these are outside the scope of knowledge management. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, knowledge creation depends upon the mechanisms described in 
the subsection on knowledge sharing, combined with the ability to put knowledge 
into practice in an environment which supports interaction and experimentation. 
The creative process is a delicate one, and it is easily ruined by strict adherence to 
rules and regulations, or by bureaucracy. Similarly, IT systems must be 
 
99 
implemented with care (as discussed above), and not attempt to replace processes 
vital to knowledge creation. 
  
 
100 
Knowledge Acquisition 
 
 
Knowledge acquisition refers to the knowledge that a firm can try to obtain from 
external sources. External knowledge sources are important, and one should 
therefore take a holistic view of the value chain (Gamble & Blackwell 2001). 
Sources include suppliers, competitors, partners/alliances, customers, and external 
experts. Communities of practice can extend well outside the firm. 
Knowledge acquisition is a topic that could fill books and extend well outside the 
knowledge management (KM) focus. For this reason, detailed descriptions of how 
to manage external relationships are beyond the scope of this topic. However, 
since KM is inextricably linked to corporate strategy, an overview of the options 
available to the organization will be helpful to understanding the full potential KM 
role. 
This subsection will discuss the knowledge available from the different sources, 
and the managerial issues that must be considered. In the subsection titled 
"External Knowledge Network", I will tie this back to the overall strategic level and 
look at the process behind external knowledge acquisition. 
The main sources are of knowledge acquisition are: 
Customers 
Customer knowledge comes in different forms. Gerbert et al (2002) identify 
three different types: 
● Knowledge for customer:  The knowledge that the customers can gain in 
order to satisfy their knowledge needs. It can include product, market, and 
supplier knowledge. It can be sourced from our company or from other 
external sources like other customers and competitors (Zanjani 2008). 
● Knowledge about customer:  The kind of knowledge that enables us to 
know the customer better, to understand their motivations, and to address 
 
101 
them better. Includes requirements, expectations, and purchasing 
activities. 
● Knowledge from customer:  The kind of knowledge that deals with 
products, suppliers, and markets. It can be used to improve our products 
and services. 
These three categories apply to actual knowledge acquisition as well as to data 
and information, which can be processed and used to create knowledge (Zanjani 
2008); e.g. data on purchasing habits could be analyzed to create knowledge that 
could improve marketing or design decisions. 
Knowledge sharing is thus important, although it may take many different forms 
depending on the area of business. KM is particularly important for B2B 
relationships where the buyers are usually more prominent (i.e. either buy many 
products or buy expensive products) and the products are more likely to be 
customized to the needs of the customer. This can, and often should result in a 
closer relationship with more detailed communication and feedback, where the 
customers are involved as partners when discussing modifications and 
improvements (Gerbert et al 2002). 
Some possible KM initiatives thus include: 
● Collecting feedback 
● Collecting and processing marketing related information 
● Collecting suggestions 
● Involvement in development/design 
Effective acquisition of customer knowledge is dependent on customer 
relationship management. IT can be used in this context both as a means of 
collecting feedback and enhancing communication and cooperation between 
partners (the principles of knowledge sharing apply here within the confines of the 
specific relationship). It is also useful as a way to gather data and information 
regarding sales, trends, feedback, and so on, which can then be used to create new 
knowledge within the organization. 
 
102 
Suppliers 
Chan (2009) presents a classification for supplier knowledge based on the 
concepts outlined by Gerbert et al (2002) regarding customer knowledge. These 
are: 
● Knowledge for suppliers: This is the knowledge that suppliers require and 
includes "production needs and forecasts, inventory, products, customers, 
and markets" (Chan 2009). 
● Knowledge about suppliers: This is knowledge that is used to understand 
how the supplier can match the requirements of the organization; provide 
insight regarding quality, delivery, defects, financial risks etc. 
● Knowledge from suppliers: This refers to the knowledge that suppliers 
have gathered from their dealings with the organization. 
The KM initiatives and the role of IT are similar to the ones presented in the 
customer segment, with the organization now taking on the role of customer. 
Knowledge acquisition in this case also includes data and information which can be 
processed and used as building blocks for new knowledge creation. 
Gamble and Blackwell (2001) refer to compatible goals, cultural alignment, and 
leadership commitment amongst the key factors for sustained, productive, long-
term relationships. 
Competitors 
This deserves mention, but it is a fairly straightforward aspect of KM. It simply 
involves collecting, organizing and presenting the data, information, and 
knowledge that the firm has acquired in such a way that one can search, retrieve, 
and analyze it. Some of this falls within the scope of information management, but 
it is particularly the process of using these components to create better decisions 
and new knowledge that is of interest here. 
IT systems are very useful in this case, since the sources are largely explicit an d 
presumably require frequent updating and manipulation. Data mining and 
analysis, document management systems with suitable search functions, and 
expert systems are most relevant here. 
 
103 
Partners/alliances 
Alliances intended to increase knowledge are a valuable potential resource. 
However, these must be properly managed. Key success factors include fostering 
trust, learning from your partner, and effectively managing the creation of 
knowledge relevant to both parties. Knowledge transfer can be facilitated by 
personnel exchanges, common projects and other forms of regular interaction, 
technology sharing, etc. (Gamble & Blackwell 2001). Focusing on informal 
communication, collaboration, and socialization is of paramount importance for 
valuable tacit knowledge acquisition and for extending communities of practice 
beyond the firm's borders. 
Chan (2009) once again formulates a set of knowledge types based around the 
work of Gerbert et al (2002): 
● Knowledge for partners:  Knowledge which satisfies their needs, including 
"knowledge about products, markets, and suppliers" (Chan 2009). 
● Knowledge about partners:  Knowledge acquisition focused on 
understanding the ability of partners to perform their role in the 
relationship. Includes distribution channels, products, services, etc. 
● Knowledge from partners: The knowledge that partners have accumulated 
from dealing with the organization. 
IT can be used in this case very similarly to the way it is used inside the 
organization for knowledge sharing and knowledge creation (including 
data/information analysis) - in other words supporting communication, 
collaboration, experimentation, expertise location, analysis tools, etc. The exact 
system has to fit the nature of the relationship and the business model. 
What is of particular importance in this case is to safeguard the system so that 
only that knowledge which the firm is willing to share becomes available. In the 
80s, joint ventures between American and Japanese firms often resulted in a 
lopsided endeavor favoring the latter, since the Japanese were far more willing to 
listen, and the Americans were far more willing to talk. It is important to 
remember that the goal here is two-way learning; that a relationship will not last 
forever; and that a partner today may be a competitor tomorrow. KM must 
 
104 
therefore be very aware of what knowledge is being shared, and the IT systems 
must reflect this policy. 
Merges & Acquisitions 
This aspect deserves mention, but as a general discipline it is well beyond the 
scope of this paper. Dealing with mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is an extremely 
complex task that has led to numerous failures. Within the scope of knowledge 
acquisition, the area related to KM is how to pass on the most amount of relevant 
knowledge from the previous two organizations to the new, combined firm. 
Very broadly speaking there are a couple of roles where KM efforts should 
feature heavily once the target has been acquired: 
To identify the valuable/redundant knowledge sources in the target 
organization: This is a very difficult process since it involves understanding of the 
target company's tacit and embedded knowledge locked within people, 
communities, processes, networks, procedures, etc. One of the major causes of 
failure in M&A is that during the restructuring process, key people are let go by 
mistake or key communities are disrupted. The old adage that the company should 
be seen more like a living organism than a machine holds very true here. 
 
To combine this (relevant) knowledge with the organization's knowledge 
assets to achieve synergy: This is the essence of many M&A; the notion that the 
whole should be greater than the sum of its parts. Integrating acquired companies 
is a difficult task, heavy on people management and the creation of a common 
culture. It is hard to say how much of this falls within KM specifically, and there 
certainly are no universal rules on this topic. Fundamentally, the same principles 
on knowledge sharing, reuse, and creation apply here, with a particular focus on 
culture, networks, and incentives, within a different and potentially hostile 
environment. 
Other expertise 
This refers to the other sources of external knowledge available to a firm and 
includes hiring new personnel or acquiring the services of consultants. 
 
105 
The role of KM in these cases is to make sure that the right knowledge is 
acquired. Essentially the process has two parts, on the one hand the strategic and 
tactical requirements of the firm must be taken into account, and on the other 
these must be compared to the knowledge assets of the organization. 
If external services are acquired from consultants or other temporary service 
providers, KM must work together with strategic management to determine if this 
knowledge is worth integrating into the firm by assessing the need to reuse it in 
the future vs the cost of transferring it into the organization. If it is deemed as 
something that should be integrated, then the right learning situations must be 
established to transfer the knowledge into the firm. These could be mentoring 
relationships, use of project teams that include organizational members, courses 
and education, etc.

Introduction to Knowledge Management Strategy 
 
While the knowledge management processes section dealt with the general 
ways knowledge can be managed, this section tackles long-term knowledge 
management strategy. Strategic investments represent the company ’s 
choices/options so as to enable and enhance the processes outlined earlier (e.g. 
knowledge sharing) and to offer help define which knowledge is relevant (i.e. in 
line with strategic objectives) and which is not. 
This section is based on the strategic part of the integrated knowledge 
management model, which includes: 
● Knowledge management strategic initiatives: 
● Invest: Support of existing structures, competencies, knowledge retention 
mechanisms, culture, external network, and knowledge management 
systems 
● Invest: Implement changes to structures, competencies, knowledge 
retention mechanisms, culture, external network, and knowledge 
management systems 
● Divest: Remove obsolete knowledge 
The articles that follow are based solely on the points under "invest". Based on 
that we arrive at the following headings: 
● KM and Organizational Structures 
● KM and Organizational Culture 
● KM and Knowledge Retention 
● KM and Core Competencies 
● KM and External Knowledge Network 
● KM and Knowledge Management Systems 
● Summary: Knowledge Management Best Practices 
As many of you might realize, many of the strategic initiatives deal with aspects 
that extend into different branches of management. I will endeavor to stick to the 
scope of this subsection and, for the most part, limit my discussion only to aspects 
relevant to knowledge management strategy. Furthermore, at all stages of the 
 
109 
following discussion on knowledge management strategy, I will also refer to 
different knowledge types and to IT systems, whenever necessary. However, the 
subsection dealing with knowledge management systems will be the first that 
focuses specifically on IT. It will discuss the general implementation issues, leading 
to the subsequent section that looks at some specific systems and tools. 
At the end, I will present a summary of all the conclusions and 
recommendations made throughout this section and the one on knowledge 
management processes, in a subsection titled Knowledge Management Best 
Practices. This will serve as a way to provide a quick overview of knowledge 
management strategy and could be read on its own by readers who are not 
interested in a more detailed account.

Invest: Managing Organizational Structures 
 
This discussion deals with the physical and non-physical divisions and barriers 
that influence the way knowledge management (KM) operate. By "organizational 
structure", I refer to the layout of the company itself and also to the various bodies 
that exist within it. 
It is important to note that many elements within this topic stretch well outside 
our focus, and volumes could be written on it alone. The focus here will be only on 
the general elements that are directly related to KM. 
Types of Organizational Structures 
Organizational structures deal with the way the firm is organized, and the way 
people relate to one another. Broadly speaking, there are two types of 
organizational structure, namely formal and informal. These two concepts are not 
independent, and the formal structure may greatly influence informal networks, 
both positively and negatively. 
Formal: The official structure of the organization, which is normally displayed on 
an organizational chart, and which denotes the hierarchical relationships between 
members of the firm. It is beyond the scope of this site to offer a discussion on the 
various formal organizational structures. However, there are a few things that are 
relevant to KM: 
1. The formal organizational structure must not be so rigidly enforced so as to 
stifle informal structures such as communities of practice, where 
knowledge sharing, and creation may take place. It is the knowledge 
manager's job to understand the knowledge dynamics of the organization 
and to recognize how the formal and informal structures coexist. 
2. The formal organizational structure, particularly in a larger firm with 
separate departments, will impact knowledge flows. There is no set 
structure that is best, since most have advantages and disadvantages 
depending upon the business type, firm size, etc. However, studies seem to 
 
111 
indicate that flatter, decentralized structures are more effective for KM 
(Choi & Lee 2000, Claver-Cortés et al 2007, Chen & Huang 2007). This also 
makes sense logically, since knowledge flows would be less hindered in 
such a structure. 
Implementing changes to formal structures can thus mean restructuring the 
organization, but it can also mean enforcing existing structures to a lesser or 
greater degree. 
Informal: The unofficial organizational structures are the ones that are created 
through informal networks, as a result of working within the organization. They 
represent the way people actually interact. Brown and Duguid (1992) advocated 
looking at the firm as a community of communities. Increasingly, the value of 
these informal structures is being understood, and the knowledge manager must 
learn to identify and support these networks. This process is closely related to KM, 
since knowledge flows and repositories (particularly tacit) are dependent upon 
these structures. KM therefore must play a central role in their management, 
including identification of the structures and the knowledge they hold, 
implementing changes, bridging gaps between communities, and so on. 
Unfortunately, implementing changes to informal social networks is difficult 
without running the risk of disrupting them. There are however several ways that 
managers can influence social networks: 
● Generalists (sometimes referred to as gatekeepers) can be used to identify 
communities and their expert know-how, and to help coordinate activities 
such as cross-functional projects. 
● Project teams and other teamwork can serve as a means to bridge the gap 
between communities. 
● Common physical meeting areas can allow communities to grow and 
flourish. 
● Virtual socialization and people finders can support communities of 
practice. 
● Common vision, goals, ideals, social gatherings etc. and a climate of trust 
can serve as a way to lessen the distance between organizational members 
and communities. 
  
 
112 
Invest: Corporate Culture Change 
 
The concept of organizational/corporate culture has already been discussed in a 
previous subsection. I will therefore keep my introduction to the subject to a 
minimum, and instead focus almost exclusively on corporate culture change. 
Organizational culture represents the way things are done in an organization, 
encompassing the values, beliefs, and attitude that generate a common 
framework for interpreting events. 
Knowledge sharing, and thus all aspects related to knowledge management 
(KM), depend upon organizational culture. Trust is a particularly important issue, 
since workers need to feel secure that they are not jeopardizing themselves by 
engaging in knowledge sharing. In order for proper cooperation to take place, 
management must create a culture where knowledge sharing is seen as beneficial 
for the individual as well as the organization. Managing corporate culture change 
is therefore at the very core of KM and organizational learning processes. 
Defining and Mapping Organizational Culture 
Johnson (2001) presents a model called the cultural web (see below), outlining 
the various components of organizational culture. 

 
113 
The paradigm:  The set of assumptions shared and taken for granted by the 
organization. 
Rituals and Routines:  These represent "the way we do things around here". 
They point to what is valued and include behaviors that are taken for granted as 
being correct. 
Stories and myths:  The organization's folklore that passes on the common 
perception of past events, thus reinforcing beliefs and passing them on to 
newcomers. 
Symbols: All the symbolic elements of the firm, including titles and dress codes. 
Control Systems:  Systems that are designed to promote certain activities by 
rewarding correct behavior and monitoring performance. 
Org. Structures:  The formal structure of the organization, as explained in the 
subsection on organizational structures (though in this case it is considered solely 
in regards to its influence on culture). 
Power structures: The more powerful groups are also most likely to be involved 
in shaping the paradigm. A big problem arises when "the main targets for change 
are also those who hold the power." (Bali et al 2009). 
Johnson (2001) advocates culture mapping according to this framework so as to 
assess the culture as a whole and be able to determine its compatibility with 
strategy. 
Managing Corporate Culture Change 
Wellman (2009) presents a series of leadership roles that will help facilitate 
corporate culture change towards a knowledge friendly culture: 
● Acknowledge the existence and influence of organizational culture: It must 
be brought into the open so people can see and understand how it affects 
activities 
● Have a clear and persistent vision of what the culture should be and of 
what changes need to be applied: This vision must be understood by 
management at all levels and spread across the organization. 
 
114 
● Consciously manage culture: Wellman suggests the using health 
assessments and employee surveys to evaluate progress and direction. 
Expanding upon this, one might add the use of incentives (whatever is 
suitable within that particular organization) and of using managers as 
intermediaries between different cultures within the organization. 
Management must strive to create a culture where knowledge sharing is 
perceived as beneficial to the whole and also to the individual. In other 
words, through shared vision, incentives, etc. they must foster an 
atmosphere of trust to ensure that individuals have faith in the principle of 
reciprocity. They must also bridge cultural differences that exist between 
different communities and power structures within the organization. 
Gardner presents a somewhat more concrete approach to corporate culture 
change. He states that it is dependent on redefining the assumptions that shape 
the common understanding, or in other words the paradigm. It thus involves 
introducing "anomalies" that present a reality that cannot be true under the old 
assumptions. As more and more anomalies are presented, people will eventually 
abandon old beliefs and frames of understanding and eventually be willing to 
adopt new ones. 
No matter what, corporate culture change is a difficult process that is likely to 
meet significant resistance. Its stubbornness is due in part to the fact that it is 
history dependent, woven into everyday practice, and used as socializing 
mechanism for newcomers (Beitler 2005). However, as Beitler argues, despite all 
the hurdles, managing culture simply must be done. 
  
 
115 
Invest: Knowledge Retention 
 
Knowledge retention involves capturing knowledge in the organization so that it 
can be used later. In a previous section on organizational memory, Walsh and 
Ungson (1991) defined five knowledge repositories, namely individuals, culture, 
transformations (i.e. procedures & formalized systems), structures (e.g. formal and 
informal networks), and external activities. This is where knowledge can exist or be 
retained in an organization. In this section, we are interested in the managerial 
side, so as to answer the question: How can management promote the retention 
of (crucial) knowledge? 
Most often, one hears of knowledge retention in the context of losing key 
employees and using techniques such as exit interviews to try to capture their 
knowledge. In reality, knowledge retention should be integrated into how the 
organization operates and start well before a key employee is about to depart. 
Although it is considered crucial for long term organizational success, few 
organizations have formal knowledge retention strategies (Liebowitz 2011). 
 
116 
 
A knowledge retention strategy as a part of knowledge management (KM) will 
identify the knowledge resources that are at risk and must be retained, and then 
implement specific initiatives so as to keep these resources in the firm. Like most 
other KM-related processes and strategies, success depends upon successful 
knowledge sharing and having a knowledge sharing & learning organizational 
culture. 
Apart from the more general knowledge sharing initiatives that a firm may use - 
e.g. support of formal & informal knowledge networks (social areas, social media, 
meetings, company functions, knowledge fairs, expertise locator, etc.), changing 
the organization culture, etc. - examples of tools & techniques which can be used 
specifically for knowledge retention include (adapted from Smith 2007, Liebowitz 
2009, and Liebowitz 2011): 
● Implementing reward structures to encourage sharing of key knowledge. 
● Use of project teams and cross-functional project teams. 
● After-action reviews. 
● Storytelling. 

 
117 
● Mentoring programs & job shadowing. 
● Interviews & exit interviews. 
● Job rotation. 
● Company procedures/processes manuals. 
● Taking advantage of the knowledge of retirees. 
Knowledge Retention Strategy 
Doan et al (2011) identify three basic questions that must be asked when 
considering knowledge retention: 
● What knowledge may be lost? 
● What are the organizational consequences of losing that knowledge? 
● What actions can be taken to retain that knowledge? 
Expanding upon these questions, one can outline several concrete steps 
necessary in the formulation of a knowledge retention strategy: 
Step 1 : Understand your risk factor: Liebowitz (2011) identified the following 
risks: 
● he average age of your employees is high 
● The company has placed insufficient focus on: 
o knowledge capture 
o mentoring program 
o employee training and development 
● Information is difficult to find or is often misplaced. 
● There is little informal communication in the organization. 
● Many knowledgeable employees are leaving the organization. 
Step 2: Understand which knowledge is critical and focus on this (Corney 2018) 
(read more about this under Knowledge Organization & Assessment) 
Step 3: Formulate a strategy using the pillars of knowledge retention (Liebowitz 
2009 & 2011): Knowledge retention consists of a wide range of tools, some easy 
and some hard to implement. Liebowitz identifies four categories which 
encompass all the initiatives within knowledge retention. These are: 
● Recognition and reward structure: Management has the choice to use 
either intrinsic motivators (i.e. which make the job itself more satisfying, 
 
118 
such as praise or recognition) or extrinsic motivators (i.e. which offer 
benefits unrelated to the job, such as money) (Gamelgaard 2007). These 
must take organizational as well as national cultural factors into account 
(Gamelgaard 2007), but overall the most effective and longer lasting 
appear to be intrinsic motivators (Gamelgaard 2007 & Liebowitz 2009). 
However, a combination of both is usually the way to go. 
● Bidirectional knowledge flow: Establishing a two-way system of knowledge 
capture, where knowledge is not only passed down from the senior 
employee to the junior employee, but also vice versa. 
● Personalization and codification: Personalization refers to connecting 
people and includes tools such as mentoring, jon rotation, knowledge fairs, 
communities, and so on, while codification includes tools like after action 
reviews, various knowledge repositories, lessons learned systems, etc. 
(Liebowitz 2009). 
● The golden gem: Bringing back important retirees in various capacities. 
This includes rehire programs, consultancy, part-time work, temporary 
jobs, etc. (Corporate Executive Board 2005). Using a phased retirement 
system (e.g. leave of absence – part time work – casual rehire) can also 
help to slowly lose a key employee and to gradually transfer all his key 
knowledge to the organization (Corporate Executive Board 2005). 
Success Factors and DOs and DON'Ts of KR 
Doan et al (2011), following a comprehensive review of knowledge retention 
literature, arrive at the following key success factors: 
● Top management support 
● Knowledge retention strategy 
● Learning culture 
● Human resource practices (since knowledge resides in people, knowledge 
retention is closely linked to HR practices including recruitment, education, 
rewards, and performance management) 
● Information and communication technology tools 
Similarly, Corney (2018) outlines some basic DOs and DON'Ts of knowledge 
retention: 
 
119 
● Do not capture "just in case". This leads to repositories of unused 
information. 
● Make sure that you are focusing on capturing Critical Knowledge, i.e. 
knowledge that the organization would struggle without. 
● When departures occur, offer them the chance to "leave a legacy" in an 
alumni network. 
● Make sure that knowledge retention and capture is the "way we do things 
around here" and that it is part of any work process and at all stages of the 
employment cycle. 
  
 
120 
Invest: Knowledge Management and Core 
Competencies 
 
The knowledge management definition presented earlier, involved the reuse 
and creation of relevant knowledge. The word relevant links knowledge 
management (KM) to the concept of organizational core competencies. Once 
again, the challenge here is to discuss this subject without diverging too much into 
related topics that are not directly relevant to KM. 
Core competencies:  Definitions vary greatly. The term was originally coined by 
Pralahad and Hamel (1990) who defined it as "the collective learning of the 
organization, especially how to coordinate different production skills and integrate 
multiple streams of technologies". Since then it has been defined in multiple ways, 
but very generally, core competencies refer to the firm's primary expertise, which 
is a source of sustained competitive advantage. Arriving at a more precise 
definition is not necessary for our purpose here. Suffice it to say, that these are 
key capabilities, which, from the resource-based perspective of the firm, are the 
primary drivers of innovation and competitive advantage. 
Core competencies thus have a large knowledge component, and managing 
them is, in the very least, a product of corporate strategy working with KM and 
innovation management. This simplified model has strategy dictating the overall 
direction, KM managing the knowledge dynamics, and innovation management 
turning core competencies into profitable core products. To understand the role of 
KM let us look at a brief overview of how core competencies are managed: 
1. Identifying and assessing core competencies: The firm should map out its 
key competencies, possibly linking them directly to specific core products. 
Then, an evaluation must take place, assessing what one has vs. what one 
needs to have (as determined by strategy and the competitive 
environment). KM is responsible for identifying where the key knowledge 
is located, including the tacit expertise and knowledge embedded in 
products, routines, etc., as well as identifying knowledge gaps. 
 
121 
2. Sustaining core competencies: Organizational core competencies, like all 
knowledge assets, have the virtue of improving rather than depreciating 
through use. Conversely, lack of use will lead to erosion of any skill set. The 
role of KM here is twofold, on the one hand, it must keep stock of the state 
of key knowledge assets and, on the other, it must leverage key knowledge 
assets across the organization. 
3. Building core competencies: Building new core competencies involves an 
interplay between knowledge, practice, coordination, and refinement. 
Knowledge assets must be built, enhanced, combined, and coordinated in 
an environment that supports experimentation and improvement. Building 
core competencies can be a complicated endeavor since sustained 
competitive advantage is derived from assets that are hard to imitate 
(Dierickx and Cool 1989). From a KM perspective, this implies the buildup 
of specific tacit knowledge and expertise (i.e. uncodified knowledge that is 
generally more valuable, and inherently more difficult to copy and 
transfer), often across multiple departments or functions. 
4. Unlearning core competencies: Organizations have a habit of trying to 
keep doing what they have always been doing. Unlearning a competency 
when it is no longer useful is one of the key aspects of a successful firm, 
and history is riddled with examples of companies that have failed to do 
so. In the process of unlearning, KM again plays an important role by 
identifying and managing the firm's knowledge assets in the right direction. 
This may be done through re-training, restructuring, creating new 
knowledge flows, external knowledge acquisition, outright removal, etc. 
The specific dynamics of the processes of knowledge creation, knowledge 
acquisition, knowledge sharing, and knowledge reuse, which are central to the 
management of core competencies, have been discussed earlier. The purpose of 
this section is to emphasize that KM is not just a collection of individual initiatives.  
The buildup of skills and competencies, involving the coordination of multiple KM 
disciplines with other organizational functions, must often be managed according 
to long-term strategic goals and coordinated across the organization. 
  
 
122 
Invest: Managing the External Knowledge Network 
 
Having explored the dynamics of knowledge acquisition from external sources, I 
will now briefly look at the role knowledge management (KM) has in the broader, 
long-term process of building an external knowledge network. Once again, I want 
to underline that this presentation is only intended as a broad overview of the 
potential roles of KM and will not go into any detail on specific topics such as 
customer or supplier relationship management. 
In the previous subsection, the major potential external knowledge sources 
were identified as: 
● Customers 
● Suppliers 
● Competitors 
● Partners 
● Mergers & Acquisitions 
Each of these categories offer a different set of potential knowledge, as well as 
different challenges in the acquisition process. 
Without looking specifically at KM, the general steps for extending the external 
knowledge network are as follows: 
● Identification of potential partner/target: This would depend largely on the 
corporate strategic goals assessed against the perceived benefit of the 
potential partners. 
● Evaluation of potential partner/target: This process is particularly 
important for high investment ventures like mergers and acquisitions or 
joint ventures. The process would be driven by the estimated contribution 
of the target (this includes knowledge and core competencies but also 
potentially other assets), the estimated cost of establishing the 
relationship, and the estimated cost of acquiring similar knowledge from 
other sources (including building it in-house). The word "estimated" plays a 
 
123 
key role here, since the information required to make accurate decisions is 
often hard to come by. 
● Establishing the relationship/acquisition of target: The process of actually 
establishing cooperation/acquisition. For customer, supplier, or competitor 
relationships this may involve setting up procedures, rules, and intentions 
regarding the nature of the relationship and the things that will be 
reported or shared. For mergers and acquisitions it could take any number 
of forms and may include defining a new structure, integration into a 
common locale, merging corporate cultures/identities, and so on. 
● Knowledge transferal/integration: The actual processes that are put in 
place to gather and use the knowledge and know-how from the 
relationship/acquisition. These may involve reporting procedures, 
feedback mechanisms, common IT systems, common projects etc. 
The role of KM in building the external knowledge network would thus be to: 
● Provide all the relevant information regarding internal knowledge assets: 
This includes identifying what the firm has, what it does not have, and the 
costs associated with building new knowledge. 
● Help in the evaluation process: help evaluate the potential value and 
difficulty to integrate of the knowledge that the firm expects to acquire. 
● Encourage knowledge sharing & integration: On the one hand it could 
involve working with top management so as to devise the best procedures 
and systems relating to knowledge transfer. On the other, it could involve 
introducing incentives, systems, managing organizational culture change, 
etc. that facilitate, support, and encourage knowledge sharing. 
● Gather, integrate, and share relevant external knowledge and information: 
Managing the knowledge transfer process so as to ensure that the 
knowledge is relevant and that it is available whenever and wherever 
necessary. Analyzation of data and information so as to provide the 
building blocks of new knowledge. 
As one can see, KM plays a supporting role in all areas and is instrumental in the 
learning process. Its importance will be greater the more knowledge intensive the 
industry and nature of the relationship. 
 
124 
Due to the complexity of these topics and the vastly different managerial 
requirements, I will end this discussion with just these general considerations. 
  
 
125 
Invest: Knowledge Management Systems 
 
The issue of knowledge management systems has probably always been the 
most discussed and debated topic within knowledge management (KM). However, 
in modern KM, few people would disagree with the notion that knowledge 
management systems are an absolutely critical part of a KM initiative. 
On this site, I have considered the impact of IT in all the knowledge management 
strategy subsections, with particular emphasis on its role in knowledge sharing. 
From this point on, the discussion will be organized as follows: 
● This subsection will discuss the theoretical implementation of knowledge 
management systems and its impact on the organization. 
● The section titled "KM Tools" will look at some of the main categories of 
systems available. 
What are Knowledge Management Systems? 
Knowledge management systems refer to any kind of IT system that stores and 
retrieves knowledge, improves collaboration, locates knowledge sources, mines 
repositories for hidden knowledge, captures and uses knowledge, or in some other 
way enhances the KM process. 
If my explanation above makes the definition of these systems seem vague, that 
is because there is no consensus as to what constitutes a knowledge management 
system, much like there is no consensus regarding KM. Furthermore, since KM is 
involved in all areas of the firm, drawing a line is very difficult. 
James Robertson (2007) goes as far as to argue that organizations should not 
even think in terms of knowledge management systems. He argues that KM, 
though enhanced by technology, is not a technology discipline, and thinking in 
terms of knowledge management systems leads to expectations of "silver bullet" 
solutions. Instead, the focus should be determining the functionality of the IT 
systems that are required for the specific activities and initiatives within the firm. 
 
126 
However, with proper implementation, IT systems have become a critical 
component of KM today. 
 
For the purpose of this site (intended to be useful for those people that do 
search for terms like knowledge management systems), I will break these down 
into the following general categories (adapted from the work of Gupta and Sharma 
2005, in Bali et al 2009): 
● Groupware systems & KM 2.0 
● The intranet and extranet 
● Data warehousing, data mining, & OLAP 
● Decision Support Systems 
● Content management systems 
● Document management systems 
● Artificial intelligence tools 
● Simulation tools 
● Semantic networks 
These categories will cover the vast majority of the systems that people would 
normally associate with a KM system. 
Problems and Failure Factors 
Too often, the effects of technology on the organization are not given enough 
thought prior to the introduction of a new system. There are two sets of 
knowledge necessary for the design and implementation of a knowledge 
management system (Newell et al., 2000): 
1. The technical programming and design know-how 
2. Organizational know-how based on the understanding of knowledge flows 
The problem is that rarely are both these sets of knowledge known by a single 
person. Moreover, technology is rarely designed by the people who use it. 
Therefore, firms are faced with the issue of fit between IT systems and 
organizational practices, as well as with acceptance within organizational culture 
(Gamble & Blackwell 2001). 
 
127 
Botha et al (2008) stress the importance of understanding what knowledge 
management systems cannot do. They point to the fact that introducing 
knowledge sharing technologies does not mean that experts will share knowledge 
- other initiatives have to be in place. 
Akhavan et al (2005) identify several additional failure factors including: lack of 
top management support, organizational culture, lack of a separate budget, and 
resistance to change. 
Building upon all this, and incorporating previously discussed elements, failure 
factors of knowledge management systems are as follows: 
● Inadequate support: managerial and technical, during both 
implementation and use. 
● Expecting that the technology is a KM solution in itself. 
● Failure to understand exactly what the firm needs (whether technologically 
or otherwise). 
● Not understanding the specific function and limitation of each individual 
system. 
● Lack of organizational acceptance, and assuming that if you build it, they 
will come – lack of appropriate organizational culture. 
● Inadequate quality measures (e.g. lack of content management). 
● Lack of organizational/departmental/etc. fit - does it make working in the 
organization. easier? Is a system appropriate in one area of the firm but 
not another? Does it actually disrupt existing processes? 
● Lack of understanding of knowledge dynamics and the inherent difficulty in 
transferring tacit knowledge with IT based systems (see segment on tacit 
knowledge under knowledge sharing). 
● Lack of a separate budget. 
Promoting Acceptance and Assimilation 
According to Hecht et al. (2011) the process of successful implementation has 
three stages: adoption, acceptance, and assimilation. Based on recognized models 
and theories, the authors identified three comprehensive set
