FOREWORD
Knowledge management as an organizational innovation has been with us
for more than a decade. As a discipline, it has reached a state of maturity where
we can now discern the principles, practices, and tools that make it unique. As
a discourse, it has engendered new concepts and categories for us to make sense
of the many important ways that organizations use knowledge to create value.
Given the richness of ideas and innovations that have emerged under the rubric
of knowledge management, and given the tremendous interest in schools and
organizations to learn about the subject, it is something of a mystery that there
are so few textbooks available. Perhaps it is because the ﬁeld draws upon a
wide range of subject areas, or perhaps it is because many different perspec-
tives complicate the discussion of issues that engage knowledge management.
Despite these difﬁculties, or perhaps because of them, there is a pressing need
for a textbook that presents a thoughtful, systematic view of knowledge man-
agement as a coherent body of management theory and practice. The book in
our hands answers this call.
What then is knowledge management? The ﬁrst chapter of the book gives a
well-argued answer, but for our purposes here, we may deﬁne knowledge man-
agement as a framework for designing an organization’s goals, structures, and
processes so that the organization can use what it knows to learn and to create
value for its customers and community. Thus, there is no single, universal recipe
for managing knowledge—each organization has to think through and design
its own approach. This design process will have to encompass four sets of orga-
nizational enablers posed by these questions: What is the organizational vision
or strategy driving the need to manage knowledge? What roles and structures
ought to be in place? How to develop processes and practices that promote
knowledge sharing and use? Which tools and platforms can support these
efforts? For each of these enablers, research and practice in knowledge man-
agement has identiﬁed principles, exemplars, and lessons that can help to plan
and execute an effective strategy. Considering these enablers also highlights the
special strengths of this textbook.
First and foremost there is the question of vision and strategy—why try to
manage knowledge? The book makes clear in its early pages how the creation
and application of knowledge can be the engine of organizational performance
and growth. In their attempts to pursue this vision, many organizations quickly
xiii
discover that their most daunting task is to cultivate the norms of trust, coop-
eration, and mutual respect that nourish the creation and sharing of knowl-
edge. The book recognizes this challenge, and devotes an entire chapter to
examining in detail the impact of organizational culture.
Consider next the issue of roles and structures. Departments in organiza-
tions are naturally territorial and guarded about losing control of where their
information goes to, and how it might be used. The book highlights the impor-
tance of leaders such as the Chief Knowledge Ofﬁcer or the Chief Information
Ofﬁcer who champion the collective beneﬁt of sharing information, and who
remove the barriers that prevent cooperation between departments. At the
same time, knowledge sharing cannot simply be mandated through formal
authority. Some of the most valuable knowledge sharing occurs in communi-
ties of practice that are self-organized around informal roles and relationships.
A ﬁne chapter in the book discusses communities of practice in the context of
knowledge sharing.
The process and practice of knowledge management is a central focus of the
book. After a survey of major theoretical approaches in the literature, the book
develops a new synthesis that views knowledge management as a continuous
cycle of three processes: (1) knowledge creation and capture, (2) knowledge
sharing and dissemination, (3) knowledge acquisition and application. This
“KM Cycle” model forms the organizational principle of much of the book,
and is carefully considered in the ﬁrst six chapters. The balance between
process and practice is a delicate one. A process that is regulated strictly by
rules and policies can stiﬂe creativity and experimentation. On the other hand,
relying only on informal practices may mean that new learning is dispersed
and unavailable to others in the organization.
An alluring aspect of knowledge management is the range of tools and plat-
forms that hold out the promise of transforming the ways we work with infor-
mation and knowledge. Thus, there are tools that capture and represent
content so that it can be accessed efﬁciently; tools that discover and extract
knowledge; tools that facilitate social networking and community building;
and tools that support communication and collaboration in groups. While the
discussion of tools and techniques takes place throughout the book, a system-
atic analysis is presented in a well-structured chapter that covers many recent
technological developments.
A textbook is a pedagogical apparatus, and this book has incorporated a
number of features that will enhance student learning and student-teacher
interaction. Each chapter contains learning objectives, side-boxes of short
cases, summaries of main messages, and questions for discussion. Beyond these
features, the most engaging quality of the book is the combination of experi-
ence and enthusiasm that the author brings to the subject: the insights, the
resonant examples, the lively language, and the occasional touch of humor.
The book is an invitation to students to embark on an exciting and rewarding
learning adventure.

INTRODUCTION TO
KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT IN
THEORY AND
PRACTICE
A light bulb in the socket is worth two in the pocket.
Bill Wolf (1950–2001)
This chapter provides an introduction to the study of knowledge manage-
ment (KM). A brief history of knowledge management concepts is outlined,
noting that much of KM existed before the actual term came into popular use.
The lack of consensus over what constitutes a good deﬁnition of KM is
addressed, and the concept analysis technique is described as a means of clar-
ifying the conceptual confusion that persists over precisely what KM is. The
multidisciplinary roots of KM are enumerated, together with their contribu-
tions to the discipline. The two major forms of knowledge, tacit and explicit,
are compared and contrasted. The importance of KM today for individuals,
for communities of practice, and for organizations are described, together with
the emerging KM roles and responsibilities needed to ensure successful KM
implementations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Use a framework and a clear language for knowledge management 
concepts.
2. Deﬁne key knowledge management concepts such as intellectual capital,
organizational learning and memory, knowledge taxonomy, and com-
munities of practice using concept analysis.
3. Provide an overview of the history of knowledge management and iden-
tify key milestones.
4. Describe the key roles and responsibilities required for knowledge man-
agement applications.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to manage knowledge is becoming increasingly more crucial in
today’s knowledge economy. The creation and diffusion of knowledge have
become ever more important factors in competitiveness. More and more,
knowledge is being regarded as a valuable commodity that is embedded in
products (especially high-technology products) and in the tacit knowledge of
highly mobile employees. Although knowledge is increasingly being viewed as
a commodity or an intellectual asset, it possesses some paradoxical character-
istics that are radically different from those of other valuable commodities.
These knowledge characteristics include the following:
I Use of knowledge does not consume it.
I Transferral of knowledge does not result in losing it.
I Knowledge is abundant, but the ability to use it is scarce.
I Much of an organization’s valuable knowledge walks out the door at the
end of the day.
The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web have made unlimited
sources of knowledge available to us all. Pundits are heralding the dawn of the
Knowledge Age supplanting the Industrial Era. Forty years ago, nearly half of
all workers in industrialized countries were making or helping to make things;
today that proportion is down to 20% (Drucker, 1994; Bart, 2000). Labor-
intensive manufacturing with a large pool of relatively cheap, relatively homo-
geneous labor and hierarchical management has given way to knowledge-based
organizations. There are fewer people doing more work. Organizational hier-
archies are being put aside as knowledge work calls for more collaboration.
The only sustainable advance a ﬁrm has comes from what it collectively knows,
how efﬁciently it uses what it knows, and how quickly it acquires and uses
new knowledge (Davenport and Prusak, 1998). An organization in the Knowl-
edge Age is one that learns, remembers, and acts based on the best available
information, knowledge, and know-how.
All of these developments have created a strong need for a deliberate and
systematic approach to cultivating and sharing a company’s knowledge base—
one populated with valid and valuable lessons learned and best practices. In
other words, in order to be successful in today’s challenging organizational
environment, companies need to learn from their past errors and not reinvent
the wheel again and again. Organizational knowledge is not intended to replace
individual knowledge but to complement it by making it stronger, more coher-
ent, and more broadly applicative. Knowledge management represents a delib-
erate and systematic approach to ensure the full utilization of the organization’s
knowledge base, coupled with the potential of individual skills, competencies,
thoughts, innovations, and ideas to create a more efﬁcient and effective orga-
nization. The Iaccoca Institute found that “CEOs, when asked how much of
the knowledge that is available to the organization is actually used, responded
‘only about 20%.’ Yet if this ﬁgure represented average utilization of pro-
duction capacity, it would only be acceptable to the most foolhardy CEOs”
2 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
(Agile People Enterprise Development Group Newsletter, Iacocca Institute,
Pennsylvania, November 1996).
Knowledge management (KM) was initially deﬁned as the process of apply-
ing a systematic approach to the capture, structure, management, and dissem-
ination of knowledge throughout an organization in order to work faster, reuse
best practices, and reduce costly rework from project to project (Nonaka and
Takeuchi, 1995; Pasternack and Viscio, 1998; Pfeiffer and Sutton, 1999;
Ruggles and Holtshouse, 1999). KM is often characterized by a “pack rat”
approach to content: “save it, it may prove useful sometime in the future.”
Many documents tend to be warehoused, sophisticated search engines are then
used to try to retrieve some of this content, and fairly large-scale and costly
KM systems are built. Knowledge management solutions have proven to be
most successful in the capture, storage, and subsequent dissemination of
knowledge that has been rendered explicit—particularly lessons learned and
best practices.
The focus of intellectual capital management (ICM), on the other hand, is
on those pieces of knowledge that are of business value to the organization—
referred to as intellectual capital or assets (Bontis and Nikitopoulos, 2001).
Although some of these are more visible (e.g., patents, intellectual property),
the majority consist of know-how, know-why, experience, and expertise that
tend to reside within the head of one or a few employees (Klein, 1998; Stewart,
1997). ICM is characterized by less content—because content is ﬁltered and
judged, and only the best are inventoried (the “top ten,” for example). ICM
content tends to be more representative of a person’s real thinking (contextual
information, opinions, stories) owing to its emphasis on actionable knowledge
and know-how. As a result, endeavors are less costly and the focus shifts to
learning (at the individual, community, and organizational level) rather than
to the building of systems.
A good deﬁnition of knowledge management incorporates both the captur-
ing and storing of the knowledge perspective, together with the valuing of intel-
lectual assets. For example:
Knowledge management is the deliberate and systematic coordination of an
organization’s people, technology, processes, and organizational structure in
order to add value through reuse and innovation. This coordination is achieved
through creating, sharing, and applying knowledge as well as through feeding
the valuable lessons learned and best practices into corporate memory in order
to foster continued organizational learning.
When asked, most executives often state that their greatest asset is the
knowledge held by their employees. They also invariably add that they have
no idea how to manage this knowledge! It is essential to identify that knowl-
edge that is of value and is also at risk of being lost to the organization, through
retirement, turnover, and competition using the intellectual capital or asset
approach. In addition, the selective or value-based knowledge management
approach should be a three-tiered one. That is, it should also be applied to
three organizational levels: the individual, the group or community, and the
organization itself. The best way to retain valuable knowledge is to identify
INTRODUCTION TO KM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 3
intellectual assets and then to ensure that legacy materials are produced and
subsequently stored in such a way as to make their future retrieval and reuse
as easy as possible (Stewart, 2000). These tangible by-products need to ﬂow
from individual to individual, between members of a community of practice,
and, of course, back to the organization itself, in the form of lessons learned,
best practices, and corporate memory.
Many knowledge management (KM) efforts have been largely concerned
with capturing, codifying, and sharing the knowledge held by people in organi-
zations. Although there is still a lack of consensus over what constitutes a good
deﬁnition of KM (see the next section), there is widespread agreement as to
the goals of an organization that undertakes KM. Nickols (2000) summarizes
these goals as follows: “the basic aim of knowledge management is to lever-
age knowledge to the organization’s advantage.” Some of management’s
motives are obvious: the loss of skilled people through turnover, pressures to
avoid reinventing the wheel, pressures for organization-wide innovations in
processes as well as products, management of risk, and the accelerating rate
at which new knowledge is being created. Some typical knowledge manage-
ment objectives are to:
I Facilitate a smooth transition from those retiring to their successors who are
recruited to ﬁll their positions.
I Minimize loss of corporate memory due to attrition and retirement.
I Identify critical resources and critical areas of knowledge so that the corpo-
ration “knows what it knows and does it well—and why.”
I Build up a toolkit of methods that can be used with individuals, with 
groups, and with the organization to stem the potential loss of intellectual
capital.
WHA T IS KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT?
An informal survey conducted by the author identiﬁed over 100 published
deﬁnitions of knowledge management, and of these, at least 72 could be con-
sidered very good! Clearly, KM is a multidisciplinary ﬁeld of study that covers
a lot of ground. This ﬁnding should not be surprising, for applying knowledge
to work is integral to most business activities. However, the ﬁeld of KM does
suffer from the “Three Blind Men and an Elephant” syndrome. In fact, there
are likely more than three distinct perspectives on KM, and each leads to a dif-
ferent extrapolation and a different deﬁnition.
From the business perspective:
Knowledge management is a business activity with two primary aspects:
[T]reating the knowledge component of business activities as an explicit
concern of business reﬂected in strategy, policy, and practice at all levels of the
organization; and, making a direct connection between an organization’s intel-
lectual assets—both explicit (recorded) and tacit (personal know-how)—and 
positive business results. (Barclay and Murray, 1997)
4 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
Knowledge management is a collaborative and integrated approach to the cre-
ation, capture, organization, access and use of an enterprise’s intellectual assets.
(Grey, 1996)
From the cognitive science or knowledge science perspective:
Knowledge—the insights, understandings, and practical know-how that we all
possess—is the fundamental resource that allows us to function intelligently. Over
time, considerable knowledge is also transformed to other manifestations—such
as books, technology, practices, and traditions—within organizations of all kinds
and in society in general. These transformations result in cumulated [ sic] exper-
tise and, when used appropriately, increased effectiveness. Knowledge is one, 
if not THE, principal factor that makes personal, organizational, and societal
intelligent behavior possible. (Wiig, 1993, pp. 38–39)
And, from the process/technology perspective:
Knowledge management is the concept under which information is turned into
actionable knowledge and made available effortlessly in a usable form to the
people who can apply it. (Information Week, Sept. 1, 2003)
Leveraging collective wisdom to increase responsiveness and innovation. (Carl
Frappaolo, Delphi Group, Boston, posted at http://www.destinationkm.com/
articles/default.asp?ArticleID=949)
A systematic approach to manage the use of information in order to provide
a continuous ﬂow of Knowledge to the right people at the right time enabling
efﬁcient and effective decision making in their everyday business. (Steve Ward,
Northrop Grumman, posted at http://www.destinationkm.com/articles/default.
asp?ArticleID=949)
A knowledge management system is a virtual repository for relevant informa-
tion which is critical to tasks performed daily by organizational knowledge
workers. (What Is KM?, posted at http://www.knowledgeshop.com)
Wiig (1993) also emphasizes that given the importance of knowledge in vir-
tually all areas of daily and commercial life, two knowledge-related aspects are
crucial for viability and success at any level. These are knowledge assets that
must be applied, nurtured, preserved, and used to the largest extent possible
by both individuals and organizations; and knowledge-related processes to
create, build, compile, organize, transform, transfer, pool, apply, and safeguard
knowledge that must be carefully and explicitly managed in all affected areas.
Historically, knowledge has always been managed, at least implicitly. However,
effective and active knowledge management requires new perspectives and tech-
niques and touches on almost all facets of an organization. We need to develop
a new discipline and prepare a cadre of knowledge professionals with a blend of
expertise that we have not previously seen. This is our challenge! (Wiig, in Grey,
1996)
INTRODUCTION TO KM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 5
Knowledge management is a surprising mix of strategies, tools, and tech-
niques—some of which are nothing new under the sun. Storytelling, peer-to-
peer mentoring, and learning from mistakes, for example, all have precedents
in education, training, and artiﬁcial intelligence practices. Knowledge man-
agement makes use of a mixture of techniques from knowledge-based system
design, such as structured knowledge acquisition strategies from subject matter
experts (McGraw and Harrison-Briggs, 1989) and educational technology
(e.g., task and job analysis to design and develop task support systems; see
Gery, 1991).
This makes it both easy and difﬁcult to deﬁne what KM is. At one extreme,
KM encompasses everything to do with knowledge. At the other extreme, it is
narrowly deﬁned as an information technology system that dispenses organi-
zational know-how. KM is in fact both of these and many more. One of the
few areas of consensus in the ﬁeld is that KM is a highly multidisciplinary 
ﬁeld.
Multidisciplinary Nature of KM
Knowledge management draws upon a vast number of diverse ﬁelds such
as:
I Organizational science.
I Cognitive science.
I Linguistics and computational linguistics.
I Information technologies such as knowledge-based systems, document and
information management, electronic performance support systems, and
database technologies.
I Information and library science.
I Technical writing and journalism.
I Anthropology and sociology.
I Education and training.
I Storytelling and communication studies.
I Collaborative technologies such as Computer Supported Collaborative Work
and groupware, as well as intranets, extranets, portals, and other web 
technologies.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but it serves to show the extremely 
varied roots that gave life to KM and continues to be its basis today. Figure
1-1 illustrates some of the diverse disciplines that have contributed to 
KM.
The multidisciplinary nature of KM represents a double-edged sword. On
the one hand, it is an advantage because almost anyone can ﬁnd a familiar
foundation on which to base their understanding and even practice of KM.
Someone with a background in journalism, for example, can quickly adapt his
or her skill set to the capture of knowledge from experts and reformulate them
as organizational stories to be stored in corporate memory. Someone coming
from a more technical database background can easily extrapolate his or her
skill set to design and implement knowledge repositories that will serve as the
6 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
corporate memory for that organization. However, the diversity of KM also
presents some challenges with respect to boundaries. Skeptics argue that KM
is not and cannot be said to be a separate discipline with a unique body of
knowledge. This attitude is typically represented by phrases such as “KM is
just IM (Information Management)” or “KM is nonsensical—it is just good
business practices.” It becomes very important to be able to list and describe
what set of attributes are necessary and are in themselves sufﬁcient to consti-
tute knowledge management both as a discipline and as a ﬁeld of practice that
can be distinguished from others.
One of the major attributes of KM relates to the fact that it deals with knowl-
edge as well as information. Knowledge is a more subjective way of knowing
and is typically based on experiential or individual values, perceptions, and
experience. Popular examples to distinguish data from information and from
knowledge include the following:
Data: Content that is directly observable or veriﬁable; a fact—for example,
listings of the times and locations of all movies being shown today—
I download the listings.
Information: Content that represents analyzed data—for example, “I can’t leave
before 5 so I will go to the 7:00 P.M. show at the cinema near my
ofﬁce.”
Knowledge: At that time of day, it will be impossible to ﬁnd parking. I remember
the last time I took the car I was so frustrated and stressed because I
thought I would miss the opening credits. I’ll therefore take the com-
muter train. But ﬁrst I’ll check with Al. I usually love all the movies
he hates so I want to make sure it’s worth seeing!
Another distinguishing characteristic of KM as opposed to other informa-
tion management ﬁelds is the ability of KM to address knowledge in all of its
forms, notably, tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.

Tacit knowledge is difﬁcult to articulate and also difﬁcult to put into words,
text, or drawings. In contrast, explicit knowledge represents content that has
been captured in some tangible form such as words, audio recordings, or
images. Moreover, tacit knowledge tends to reside “within the heads of
knowers,” whereas explicit knowledge is usually contained within tangible or
concrete media. However, it should be noted that this is a rather simplistic
dichotomy. In fact, “tacitness” is a property of the knower: what is easily
articulated by one person may be very difﬁcult to externalize by another. That
is, the same content may be explicit for one person and tacit for another. Some-
what of a paradox is at play here. On the one hand, highly skilled, experi-
enced, and expert individuals may ﬁnd it harder to articulate their know-how.
Novices, on the other hand, are more apt to easily verbalize what they are
attempting to do because they are typically following a manual or how-to
process. Table 1-1 summarizes some of the major properties of tacit and
explicit knowledge.
Typically, the more tacit knowledge is, the more valuable it tends to be. The
paradox lies in the fact that the more difﬁcult it is to articulate a concept such
as “story,” the more valuable that knowledge may be. This is often evidenced
when people make reference to knowledge versus know-how, or to knowledge
of something versus knowledge of how to do something. Valuable tacit knowl-
edge often results in some observable action when individuals understand and
subsequently make use of knowledge. Another perspective is that explicit
knowledge tends to represent the ﬁnal end product, whereas tacit knowledge
is the know-how or all of the processes that were required in order to produce
that ﬁnal product.

We have a habit of writing articles published in scientiﬁc journals to make the
work as ﬁnished as possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry about the
blind alleys or how you had the wrong idea at ﬁrst, and so on. So there isn’t any
place to publish, in a digniﬁed manner, what you actually did in order to do the
work (Richard Feynman, Nobel Lecture, 1966).
A popular misconception is that KM focuses on rendering whatever is tacit
into more explicit or tangible forms, and then storing or archiving these forms
somewhere, usually in some form of intranet or knowledge portal. This
approach is typiﬁed by the “build it and they will come” expectation where
organizations take an exhaustive inventory of tangible knowledge (i.e., docu-
ments, digital records) and make them accessible to all employees. Senior man-
agement is then mystiﬁed as to why employees are not using this wonderful
new resource. In fact, knowledge management is broader and includes lever-
aging the value of the organizational knowledge and know-how that accumu-
lates over time. This approach is much more holistic and user-centered and
begins not with an audit of existing documents but with a needs analysis to
better understand how improved knowledge sharing may beneﬁt speciﬁc indi-
viduals, groups, and the organization as a whole. Successful knowledge-sharing
examples are gathered and documented in the form of lessons learned and best
practices, and these then form the kernel of organizational stories.
A number of other attributes combine to make up a set of what KM should
be all about. Using the concept analysis technique is a good way to identify
these attributes.
The Concept Analysis Technique
Concept analysis is an established technique used in the social sciences, such
as philosophy and education, in order to derive a “formula” that in turn can
be used to generate deﬁnitions and descriptive phrases for highly complex
terms. We still lack a consensus on knowledge management–related terms, even
though these terms do appear to be complex enough to merit the concept analy-
sis approach. Much of the reason of this lack of consensus lies in the fact that
a word such as “knowledge” is necessarily subjective, not to mention value-
laden in interpretation.
The concept analysis approach rests on obtaining consensus on three major
dimensions of a given concept (as shown in Figure 1-2):
1. A list of key attributes that must be present in the deﬁnition, vision, or
mission statement.
2. A list of illustrative examples.
3. A list of illustrative nonexamples.
This approach is particularly useful in tackling multidisciplinary domains
such as intellectual capital, for clear criteria can be developed to enable sorting
into categories such as knowledge versus information, document management
versus knowledge management, and tangible versus intangible assets. In 
INTRODUCTION TO KM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 9
addition, valuable contributions to the organization’s intellectual capital are
derived through production of ontologies (semantic maps of key concepts),
identiﬁcation of core competencies, and identiﬁcation of knowledge, know-
how, and know-why at risk of being lost through human capital attrition.
Concept analysis can be used to visually map out conceptual information in
the process of deﬁning a word (Novak, 1990, 1991). This technique is derived
from the ﬁelds of philosophy and science education (Bareholz and Tamir, 1992;
Lawson, 1994) and is typically used in clearly deﬁning complex, value-laden
terms such as democracy or religion. It is a graphical approach to help develop
a rich, in-depth understanding of a concept. Figure 1-2 outlines the major com-
ponents of this approach.
Davenport and Prusak (1998, p. 5) decry the inability to provide a deﬁni-
tive account of knowledge management since “epistemologists have spent their
lives trying to understand what it means to know something.” Owing to this
ongoing lack of clarity and lack of consensus on a deﬁnition, knowledge man-
agement presents itself as a good candidate for this approach. In visioning
workshops, this is the ﬁrst activity that participants are asked to undertake.
The objective is to agree upon a list of key attributes that are both necessary
and sufﬁcient in order for a deﬁnition of knowledge management to be accept-
able. This task is completed by a list of examples and nonexamples, with 
justiﬁcations as to why a particular item was included on the example or
nonexample list. Semantic mapping (Jonassen, Beissner, and Yacci, 1993;
Fisher, 1990) is the visual technique used to extend the deﬁnition by display-
ing words related to it. Popular terms to distinguish clearly from knowledge
management include document management, content management, portal, and
knowledge repository. Together, the concept and semantic maps visually depict
a model-based deﬁnition of knowledge management and its closely related
terms.

In some cases, participants are given lists of deﬁnitions of knowledge man-
agement from a variety of sources so that they can “try out” their concept map
of knowledge management by analyzing these existing deﬁnitions. Deﬁnitions
are typically drawn both from the knowledge management literature and, inter-
nally, from their own organization. The use of concept deﬁnition through
concept and semantic mapping techniques can help participants rapidly reach
a consensus on a “formulaic” deﬁnition of knowledge management—that is,
one that focuses less on the actual text or words used and more on which key
concepts need to be present, what comprises a necessary and sufﬁcient (com-
plete) set of concepts, and rules of thumb to use in discerning what constitutes
an illustrative example of knowledge management.
Ruggles and Holtshouse (1999) identiﬁed the following key attributes of
knowledge management:
I Generating new knowledge.
I Accessing valuable knowledge from outside sources.
I Using accessible knowledge in decision making.
I Embedding knowledge in processes, products, and/or services.
I Representing knowledge in documents, databases, and software.
I Facilitating knowledge growth through culture and incentives.
I Transferring existing knowledge into other parts of the organization.
I Measuring the value of knowledge assets and/or impact of knowledge 
management.
Some key knowledge management attributes that continue to recur include
the following.
I Both tacit and explicit knowledge forms are addressed; tacit knowledge
(Polanyi, 1966) is knowledge that often resides only within individuals; and
knowledge that is difﬁcult to articulate such as expertise, know-how, and
tricks of the trade.
I There is a notion of added value (the “so what?” of KM).
I There is the notion of application or use of the knowledge that has been
captured, codiﬁed, and disseminated (the impact of KM).
A “good enough” or satisﬁcing deﬁnition of knowledge has been shown to
be effective (i.e., settling for “good enough” as opposed to optimizing; when
80% is done because the incremental cost of completing the remaining 20%
is disproportionately expensive and/or time-consuming in relation to the
expected additional beneﬁts). Norman (1988, pp. 50–74) noted that knowl-
edge may reside in two places: in the heads of people and in the world. It is
easy to show the faulty nature of human knowledge and memory. For example,
when typists were given caps for typewriter keys, they could not arrange them
in proper conﬁguration yet they all could type rapidly and accurately. Why the
apparent discrepancy between the precision of behavior and the imprecision
of knowledge? The answer is that not all of the knowledge required for precise
behavior has to be in the head. It can be distributed partly in the head, partly
in the world, and partly in the constraints of the world. Precise behavior can
INTRODUCTION TO KM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 11
emerge from imprecise knowledge (Ambur, 1999). For this reason once a sat-
isfactory working or operational deﬁnition of knowledge management has
been formulated, then knowledge management strategy can be conﬁdently
tackled.
It is highly recommended that each organization undertake the concept
analysis exercise to clarify its understanding of what KM means in its own
organization’s context. The best way to do so would be to work as a group,
enabling them to achieve a shared understanding at the same time that they
develop a clearer conceptualization of the KM concept. Each participant can
take a turn contributing one good example of what KM is and another example
of what KM is not. The entire group can then discuss this example–
nonexample pair in order to identify one (or several) key KM attributes. Once
the group members feel they have covered as much ground as they are likely
to, the key attributes can be summarized in the form of a KM concept
“formula” such as: “In our organization, knowledge management must include
the following: both tacit and explicit knowledge; a framework to measure the
value of knowledge assets; a process for managing knowledge assets. . . .”
HISTORY OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
Although the phrase “knowledge management” entered popular usage in the
late 1980s (e.g., conferences in KM began appearing, books on KM were pub-
lished, and the term began to be seen in business-oriented journals), KM has
been around for many decades. Librarians, philosophers, teachers, and writers
have long been making use of many of the same techniques. However, it could
also be argued that knowledge management has been around far longer than
the actual term has been in use. Denning (2000) relates how from “time imme-
morial, the elder, the traditional healer and the midwife in the village have 
been the living repositories of distilled experience in the life of the commu-
nity” (available from his website at: http://www.stevedenning.com/history_
knowledge_management.html). Some form of narrative repository has been in
existence for a long time, and people have found a variety of ways of sharing
knowledge in order to build on earlier experience, eliminate costly redundan-
cies, and avoid making at least the same mistakes again. For example, knowl-
edge sharing often took the form of town meetings, workshops, seminars, and
mentoring sessions. The primary “technology” used to transfer knowledge con-
sisted of the people themselves. Indeed, much of our cultural legacy stems from
the migration of different peoples across continents.
H.G. Wells (1938), though never using the actual term knowledge manage-
ment, described his vision of the “World Brain,” which would allow the intel-
lectual organization of the sum total of our collective knowledge. The World
Brain would represent “a universal organization and clariﬁcation of knowl-
edge and ideas” (p. xvi). Wells anticipated the World Wide Web, albeit in a
utopic idealized manner, when he spoke of “this wide gap between ...a t
present unassembled and unexploited best thought and knowledge in the
w o r l d ....W e  live in a world of unused and misapplied knowledge and skill”
12 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
(p. 10). The World Brain encapsulates many of the desirable features of the
intellectual capital approach to KM: selected, well-organized, and widely
vetted content that is maintained, kept up to date, and, above all, put to use
to generate value to users, the users’ community, and their organization.
What Wells envisaged for the entire world can easily be applied within an
organization in the form of an intranet. What is new and is termed knowledge
management is that we are now able to simulate rich, interactive, face-to-face
knowledge encounters virtually through the use of new communication tech-
nologies. Information technologies such as an intranet and the Internet enable
us to knit together the intellectual assets of an organization and organize and
manage this content through the lenses of common interest, common language,
and conscious cooperation. We are able to extend the depth and breadth or
reach of knowledge capture, sharing, and dissemination activities, as we had
not been able to do before, and we ﬁnd ourselves one step closer to Wells’
(1939) “perpetual digest . . . and a system of publication and distribution” 
(pp. 70–71) “to an intellectual uniﬁcation . . . of human memory” (pp. 86–87).
In the early 1960s, Drucker was the ﬁrst to coin the term knowledge worker
(Drucker, 1964). Senge (1990) focused on the “learning organization” as one
that can learn from past experiences stored in corporate memory systems.
Barton-Leonard (1995) documented the case of Chapparal Steel as a knowl-
edge management success story. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) studied how
knowledge is produced, used, and diffused within organizations and how such
knowledge contributed to the diffusion of innovation.
A number of people, perceiving the value of measuring intellectual assets,
recognized the growing importance of organizational knowledge as a com-
petitive asset (Sveiby, 1996; Norton and Kaplan, 1996; APQC, 1996; and
Edvinsson and Malone, 1997). A cross-industry benchmarking study was led
by APQC’s president Carla O’Dell and completed in 1996. It focused on the
following KM needs:
1. Knowledge management as a business strategy.
2. Transfer of knowledge and best practices.
3. Customer-focused knowledge.
4. Personal responsibility for knowledge.
5. Intellectual asset management.
6. Innovation and knowledge creation. (APQC, 1996)
The Entovation timeline (available at http://www.entovation.com/timeline/
timeline.htm) identiﬁes the variety of disciplines and domains that have
blended together to emerge as knowledge management. Management theorists
who have contributed signiﬁcantly to the evolution of KM include Peter
Drucker, Peter Senge, Ikujiro Nonaka, Hirotaka Takeuchi, and Thomas
Stewart. An extract of this timeline is given in Figure 1-3.
Milestones in the development of modern technology offer another per-
spective on the history of KM: industralization beginning in 1800, trans-
portation technologies in 1850, communications in 1900, computerization in
the 1950s, virtualization in the early 1980s, and the early efforts at personal-
INTRODUCTION TO KM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 13
ization and proﬁling technologies in 2000 (Deloitte, Touche, and Tohmatsu,
1999). Figure 1-4 summarizes these developmental phases.
With the advent of the information or computer age, KM has come to mean
the systematic, deliberate leveraging of knowledge assets. Technologies enable
valuable knowledge to be “remembered” via organizational learning and cor-
porate memory, and they also enable valuable knowledge to be “published”—
that is, to be widely disseminated to all stakeholders. The evolution of
knowledge management has occurred in parallel with a shift from a retail
model based on a catalog (here one should recall Ford’s famous quote that you
can have a car in any color you like—as long as it is black) to an auction model

(as exempliﬁed by eBay) to a personalization model where real-time matching
of user needs and services occurs in a win–win exchange model.
In 1969, the launch of ARPANET allowed scientists and researchers to com-
municate more easily with one another in addition to being able to exchange
their large data sets. They came up with a network protocol or language that
would allow disparate computers and operating systems to network together
across communication lines. Next, a messaging system was added to this data
ﬁle transfer network. In 1991, the nodes were transferred to the Internet and
World Wide Web. At the end of 1969, only four computers and about a dozen
workers were connected!!
Simultaneously, many key developments were occurring in information 
technologies devoted to knowledge-based systems: expert systems that sought
to capture “experts on a diskette,” intelligent tutoring systems aimed at cap-
turing “teachers on a diskette,” and artiﬁcial intelligence approaches that gave
rise to knowledge engineering in which someone was tasked with acquiring
knowledge from subject matter experts, conceptually modeling this content,
and then translating it into machine-executable code (McGraw and Harrison-
Briggs, 1989). McGraw and Harrison-Briggs describe knowledge engineering
as “involving information gathering, domain familiarization, analysis and
design efforts. In addition, accumulated knowledge must be translated into
code, tested and reﬁned” (p. 5). A knowledge engineer is “the individual
responsible for structuring and/or constructing an expert system” (p. 5). The
design and development of such knowledge-based systems have much to offer
knowledge management, which also aims at the capture, validation, and 
subsequent technology-mediated dissemination of valuable knowledge from
experts.
Books on knowledge management began to appear by the early 1990s, and
the ﬁeld picked up momentum in the mid-1990s with the development of a
number of large, international KM conferences and consortia. In 1999, Boisot
summarized some of these milestones (see Table 1-2 for an updated summary).
At the 24th World Congress on Intellectual Capital Management in January
2003, a number of KM gurus united in sending out a request to academia to

“pick up the KM torch.” Among those attending the conference were Karl
Sveiby, Leif Edvinsson, Debra Amidon, Hubert Saint-Onge, and Verna Allee.
They made a strong case that KM had up until now been led by practitioners
“problem-solving by the seat of their pants” and that it was now time to focus
on transforming KM into an academic discipline, promoting doctoral research
in the discipline, and providing a more formalized training for our future prac-
titioners. Today, over 100 universities around the world offer courses in KM,
and many business and library schools offer degree programs in KM (Petrides
and Nodine, 2003).
From Physical Assets to Knowledge Assets
Knowledge has become increasingly more valuable than the more traditional
physical or tangible assets. For example, traditionally, an airline organization’s
assets included the physical inventory of airplanes. Today, the airlines’ great-
est asset is the SABRE reservation system, software that enables the airline not
only to manage the logistics of its passenger reservations but also to implement
a seat “yield management system.” The yield management system refers to an
optimization program that is used to ensure that maximum revenue is gener-
ated from each seat sold—even if each and every seat carries a distinct price.
Similarly, in the manufacturing sector, the value of nonphysical assets such as
just-in-time (JIT) inventory systems is rapidly providing more value. These are
examples of intellectual assets , which generally refer to an organization’s
recorded information, and human talent where such information is typically
either inefﬁciently warehoused or simply lost, especially in large, physically dis-
persed organizations (Stewart, 1991).
This has led to a change in focus to the useful lifespan of a valuable piece
of knowledge. When is some knowledge of no use? What about knowledge
that never loses its value? The notion of knowledge obsolescence and archiv-
ing needs to be approached with a fresh eye. It is no longer advisable to simply
discard items that are “past their due date.” Instead, content analysis and a
cost-beneﬁt analysis are needed to manage each piece of valuable knowledge
in the best possible way.
Intellectual capital is often made visible by the difference between the book
value and the market value of an organization (often referred to as goodwill).
Intellectual assets are represented by the sum total of what employees of the
organization know and what they know how to do. The value of these knowl-
edge assets is at least equal to the cost of re-creating this knowledge. The
accounting profession still has considerable difﬁculty in accommodating itself
to these new forms of assets. Some progress has been made (e.g., Skandia was
the ﬁrst organization to report intellectual capital as part of its yearly ﬁnan-
cial report), but much more work remains to be done in this area. As shown
in Figure 1-5, intellectual assets may be found at the strategic, tactical, and
operational levels of an organization.
Some examples of intellectual capital include:
1. Competence—the skills necessary to achieve a certain (high) level of 
performance.
16 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
2. Capability—strategic skills necessary to integrate and apply compe-
tencies.
3. Technologies—tools and methods required to produce certain physical
results.
Core competencies, found at a tactical level, are the things that an orga-
nization knows how to do well and that provide a competitive advantage. Some
examples would be a process, a specialized type of knowledge, or a particular
kind of expertise that is rare or unique to the organization. Capabilities, found
at a more strategic level, are those things that an individual knows how to do
well, which, under appropriate conditions, may be aggregated to organiza-
tional competencies. Capabilities are potential core competencies, and sound
KM practices are required in order for that potential to be realized. A number
of business management texts discuss these concepts in greater detail (e.g.,
Hamel and Prahalad, 1990). It should be noted that the more valuable a capa-
bility is and the less it is shared among many employees, then the more vul-
nerable the organization becomes should those employees leave.
Organizational Perspectives on Knowledge Management
Wiig (1993) considers knowledge management in organizations from three
perspectives, each with different horizons and purposes:
1. Business Perspective—focusing on why, where, and to what extent the
organization must invest in or exploit knowledge. Strategies, products
and services, alliances, acquisitions, or divestments should be consid-
ered from knowledge-related points of view.
2. Management Perspective—focusing on determining, organizing, direct-
ing, facilitating, and monitoring knowledge-related practices and activ-
ities required to achieve the desired business strategies and objectives.

3. Hands-on Perspective—focusing on applying the expertise to conduct

The business perspective easily maps onto the strategic nature of knowledge
management, the management perspective is parallel to the tactical layer, and
the hands-on perspective may be equated with the operational level.
WHY IS KM IMPORTANT TODAY?
The major business drivers behind today’s increased interest in and applica-
tion of KM lie in four key areas:
1. Globalization of business. Organizations today are more global—
multisite, multilingual, and multicultural in nature.
2. Leaner organizations. We are doing more and we are doing it faster, but
we also need to work smarter as knowledge workers, adopting an
increased pace and workload.
3. “Corporate amnesia.” We are more mobile as a workforce, which
creates problems of knowledge continuity for the organization and
places continuous learning demands on the knowledge worker. We no
longer expect to spend our entire work life with the same organization.
4. Technological advances. We are more connected. Advances in informa-
tion technology not only have made connectivity ubiquitous but have
radically changed expectations. We are expected to be “on” at all times,
and the turnaround time in responding is now measured in minutes, not
weeks.
Today’s work environment is more complex because we now need to attend
daily to the increase in the number of subjective knowledge items. Filtering
over 200 e-mails, faxes, and voicemail messages on a daily basis should be
done according to good time management practices and ﬁltering rules, but
more often than not, workers tend to exhibit a “Pavlovian reﬂex” when they
note the beeps announcing the arrival of new mail or the ringing of the phone
that demands immediate attention. Knowledge workers are increasingly being
asked to “think on their feet,” with little time to digest and analyze incoming
data and information, let alone retrieve, access, and apply relevant experien-
tial knowledge. This is due both to the sheer volume of tasks to address and
to the greatly diminished turnaround time. Today’s expectation is that every-
one is “on” all the time—as evidenced by the various messages expressing
annoyance when voicemails are not responded to promptly or e-mails are not
acknowledged.
Knowledge management represents one response to the challenge of trying
to manage this complex, information-overloaded work environment. As such,
KM is perhaps best categorized as a science of complexity. One of the largest
contributors to the complexity is that information overload represents only the
tip of the iceberg—only that information that has been rendered explicit. KM
18 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
also must deal with the yet to be articulated or tacit knowledge. To further
complicate matters, we may not even be aware of all the tacit knowledge that
exists; we may not “know that we don’t know.” Maynard Keynes (in Wells,
1938, p. 6) hit upon a truism when he stated that “these ...d i r ective people
who are in authority over us, know scarcely anything about the business they
have in hand. Nobody knows very much, but the important thing to realize is
that they do not even know what is to be known.” While Keynes was address-
ing politics and the economic consequences of peace, today’s organizational
leaders have echoed his words countless times.
In fact, we are now, according to Snowden (2002), entering the third gen-
eration of knowledge management, one devoted to context, narrative, and
content management. In the ﬁrst generation, the emphasis was placed on con-
tainers of knowledge or information technologies in order to help us with the
dilemma exempliﬁed by the much quoted phrase “if only we knew what we
know” (O’Dell and Grayson, 1998). The early adopters of KM, large con-
sulting companies that realized that their primary product was knowledge and
that they needed to inventory their knowledge stock more effectively, exem-
pliﬁed this phase. A great many intranets and internal knowledge management
systems were implemented during the ﬁrst KM generation. This was the 
generation devoted to ﬁnding all the information that had up until then been
buried in the organization with commonly produced by-products encapsulated
as reusable best practices and lessons learned.
Reeling from information overload, the second generation swung to the
opposite end of the spectrum to focus on people, which could be phrased as
“if only we knew who knows about.” There was growing awareness of the
importance of human and cultural dimensions of knowledge management as
organizations pondered why the new digital libraries were entirely devoid of
content (“information junkyards”) and why the usage rate was so low. In fact,
the information technology approach of the ﬁrst KM generation leaned heavily
toward a top-down, organization-wide monolithic KM system. In the second
generation, it became quite apparent that a bottom-up or grassroots adoption
of KM led to much greater success and that there were many grassroots move-
ments—which later became dubbed communities of practice. Communities of
practice are good vehicles to study knowledge sharing or the movement of
knowledge throughout the organization to spark not only reuse for greater efﬁ-
ciency but also knowledge creation for greater innovation.
The third stage of KM brought about an awareness of the importance of
shared context: how to describe and organize content so that intended end
users are aware it exists and can easily access and apply this content. Shared
context creates shared meaning. Content needs to be abstracted from context.
This phase is characterized by the advent of metadata to describe the content
in addition to the format of content, content management, and knowledge tax-
onomies. After all, if knowledge is not put to use to beneﬁt the individual, the
community of practice, and/or the organization, then knowledge management
has failed. Bright ideas in the form of light bulbs in the pocket are not enough;
they must be “plugged in,” and this can only be possible if people know what
there is to be known, can ﬁnd it when they need to, can understand it, and—
perhaps most important—are convinced that this knowledge should be put

to work. A slogan for this phase might be something like: “taxonomy before
technology” (Koenig, 2002, p. 3).
KM for Individuals, Communities, and Organizations
Knowledge management provides beneﬁts to individual employees, to com-
munities of practice, and to the organization itself. This three-tiered view of
KM helps emphasize why KM is important today (see Figure 1-6).
For the individual, KM:
I Helps people do their jobs and save time through better decision making and
problem solving.
I Builds a sense of community bonds within the organization.
I Helps people to keep up to date.
I Provides challenges and opportunities to contribute.
For the community of practice, KM:
I Develops professional skills.
I Promotes peer-to-peer mentoring.
I Facilitates more effective networking and collaboration.
I Develops a professional code of ethics that members can follow.
I Develops a common language.
For the organization, KM:
I Helps drive strategy.
I Solves problems quickly.
I Diffuses best practices.
I Improves knowledge embedded in products and services.
I Cross-fertilizes ideas and increases opportunities for innovation.
I Enables organizations to stay ahead of the competition better.
I Builds organizational memory.
Some critical KM challenges are to manage content effectively, facilitate col-
laboration, help knowledge workers connect and ﬁnd experts, and help the

organization to learn and make decisions based on complete, valid, and well-
interpreted data, information, and knowledge.
In order for knowledge management to succeed, it has to tap into what is
important to knowledge workers—what is of value to them and to their pro-
fessional practice as well as what the organization stands to gain. It is impor-
tant to get the balance right. If the KM initiative is too big, it risks being too
general, too abstract, too top-down, and far too remote to catalyze the requi-
site level of buy-in from individuals. If the KM initiative is too small, however,
then it may not be enough to provide sufﬁcient interaction between knowledge
workers to generate synergy. The KM technology must be supportive, and man-
agement must commit itself to putting into place the appropriate rewards and
incentives for knowledge management activities. Last but not least, participants
need to develop KM skills in order to participate effectively. These KM skills
and competencies are quite diverse and varied, given the multidisciplinary
nature of the ﬁeld, but one particular link is often neglected, and that is the
link between KM skills and information professionals’ skills. KM has resulted
in the emergence of new roles and responsibilities, and a great many of these
can beneﬁt from a healthy foundation based not only in information technol-
ogy (IT) but also in information science. KM professionals have a crucial role
to play in all processes of the KM cycle, which is described in more detail in
Chapter 2.
KEY POINTS
I KM is not necessarily “completely new” but has been practiced in a wide
variety of settings for some time now—albeit under different monikers.
I Knowledge is more complex than data or information; it is subjective, often
based on experience, and highly contextual.
I There is no generally accepted deﬁnition of KM, but most practitioners and
professionals concur that KM treats both tacit and explicit knowledge with
the objective of adding value to the organization.
I Each organization should deﬁne KM in terms of its own business objectives;
concept analysis is one way of accomplishing this.
I KM is all about applying knowledge in new, previously unencumbered or
novel situations.
I KM has its roots in a variety of different disciplines.
I The KM generations to date have focused ﬁrst on containers, next on com-
munities, and ﬁnally on the content itself.
DISCUSSION POINTS
1. Use concept analysis to clarify the following terms:
a. Intellectual capital versus physical assets.
b. Tacit knowledge versus explicit knowledge.
c. Community of practice versus community of interest.

CYCLE
A little knowledge that acts is worth inﬁnitely more than much knowledge that

Kahlil Gibran (1883–1931)
This chapter describes the major phases involved in the knowledge man-
agement cycle, encompassing the capture, creation, codiﬁcation, sharing,
accessing, application, and reuse of knowledge within and between organiza-
tions. Four major approaches to KM cycles are presented from Meyer and
Zack (1996), Bukowitz and Williams (2000), McElroy (2003), and Wiig
(1993). A synthesis of these approaches is then developed as a framework for
following the path information takes to become a valuable knowledge asset
for a given organization. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the strate-
gic and practical implications of managing knowledge throughout the KM
cycle.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Describe how valuable individual, group, and organizational knowledge
is captured, created, codiﬁed, shared, accessed, applied, and reused
throughout the knowledge management cycle.
2. Compare and contrast major KM life-cycle models, including the Zack,
Bukowitz and Williams, McElroy, and Wiig life-cycle models.
3. Deﬁne the key steps in each process of the KM cycle and provide con-
crete examples of each.
4. Identify the major challenges and beneﬁts of each phase of the KM cycle.
5. Describe how the integrated KM cycle combines the advantages of other
KM life-cycle models.
INTRODUCTION
Effective knowledge management requires an organization to identify, gen-
erate, acquire, diffuse, and capture the beneﬁts of knowledge that provide a
strategic advantage to that organization. A clear distinction must be made
between information—which is digitizable—and true knowledge assets—
which can only exist within the context of an intelligent system. As we are still
far from the creation of artiﬁcial intelligence systems, this means that knowl-
edge assets reside within the human knowers, and not the organization per se.
A knowledge information cycle can be envisaged as the route information
follows in order to become transformed into a valuable strategic asset for the
organization via a knowledge management cycle.
One of the major KM processes aims at identifying and locating knowledge
and knowledge sources within the organization. Valuable knowledge is then
translated into explicit form, often referred to as codiﬁcation of knowledge, in
order to facilitate more widespread dissemination. Networks, practices, and
incentives are instituted to facilitate person-to-person knowledge transfer as
well as person–knowledge content connections in order to solve problems,
make decisions, or otherwise act based on the best possible knowledge foun-
dation. Once this valuable, ﬁeld-tested knowledge and know-how is transferred
to an organizational knowledge repository, it is said to become part of “cor-
porate memory.” This is sometimes also referred to as “ground truth.”
As was the case with a generally accepted deﬁnition of KM, a similar lack
of consensus exists with respect to the terms used to describe the major steps
in the KM cycle. Table 2-1 summarizes the major terms found in the KM 
literature.
Upon closer inspection, however, the differences are not really that great.
The terms used differ, but there does appear to be some overlap in the differ-
ent types of steps involved in a KM cycle. To this end, four models were selected
based on their ability to meet the following criteria:
I They are implemented and validated in real-world settings.
I They are comprehensive with respect to the different types of steps found in
the KM literature.
I They include detailed descriptions of the KM processes involved in each step.
These four models are the Zack, from Meyer and Zack (1996), the Bukowitz
and Williams (2000), the McElroy (2003), and the Wiig (1993) KM cycles.
MAJOR APPROACHES TO THE KM CYCLE
The Zack KM Cycle
The Zack KM cycle is derived from work on the design and development of
information products (Meyer and Zack, 1996). A number of lessons learned
from the cycle that physical products follow within an organization can be

applied to the management of knowledge assets. Information products are
broadly deﬁned as information “sold” to internal or external customers 
such as databases, news synopses, and customer proﬁles. Meyer and Zack
(1996) propose that research and knowledge about the design of physical prod-
ucts can be extended into the intellectual realm to serve as the basis for a KM
cycle.
This approach provides a number of useful analogies, such as the notion of
a product platform (the knowledge repository) and the information process
platform (the knowledge reﬁnery) to emphasize the notion of value-added pro-
cessing required in order to leverage the knowledge of an organization. The
KM cycle consists primarily of creating a higher value-added “knowledge
product” at each stage of knowledge processing. For example, a basic data-
base may represent an example of knowledge that has been created. Value can
then be added by extracting trends from this data. The original information
has been repackaged to provide trend analyses that can serve as the basis for
decision making within the organization. Similarly, competitive intelligence can
be gathered and synthesized in order to repackage “raw” data into meaning-
ful, interpreted, and validated knowledge that is of immediate value to users.
That is to say, it can be put into action directly. Yet another example is a news-
gathering service that summarizes or repackages information to meet the needs
of distinct, different individuals through proﬁling and personalization of value-
added activities.
Meyer and Zack echoed other authors in stressing “the importance of 
managing the evolution and renewal of product architecture for sustained 
competitive success. . . . different architectures result in different product func-
tionality, cost, quality and performance. Architectures ar e...a  basis for
product innovation” (p. 44). Research and knowledge about the design of
physical information products can inform the design of a KM cycle. In Meyer
and Zack’s approach, the interfaces between each stage are designed to be
seamless and standardized. Experience suggests the critical importance of spec-
ifying internal and external user interfaces in order to do so.
The Meyer and Zack KM cycle processes are composed of the technologies,
facilities, and processes for manufacturing products and services. The authors
suggest that information products are best viewed as a repository comprising
information content and structure. Information content is the data held in the
repository that provides the building blocks for the resulting information prod-
ucts. The content is unique for each type of business or organization. For
example, banks have content relating to personal and commercial accounts;
insurance companies hold information on policies and claims; and pharma-
ceutical companies accumulate a large body of scientiﬁc and marketing knowl-
edge around each product under design or currently sold.
In addition to the actual content, the other important elements to consider
are the overall structure and approach to how the content is stored, manipu-
lated, and retrieved. The information unit is singled out as the formally deﬁned
atom of information to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated. This notion of
a unit of information is a critical concept that should be applied to knowledge
items as well. A focus at the level of a knowledge object distinguishes KM from
document management. Although a document management system (DMS)
28 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
stores, manipulates, and retrieves documents as integral wholes, KM can easily
identify, extract, and manage a number of different knowledge items (some-
times referred to as knowledge objects) within the same document. The unit
under study is thus quite different, both in nature and in scale. This again links
us back to the notion that KM is not about the exhaustive collection of volu-
minous content but rather about more selective sifting and modiﬁcation of
existing captured content. The term often used today is content management
systems.
Different businesses once again make use of unique meaningful information
units. For example, a repository of ﬁnancial statements is held in Mead’s Data
System Nexis, and the footnotes can be deﬁned as information units. A user is
able to select a particular ﬁnancial statement for analysis based on key attri-
butes of the footnotes. An expertise location system may have, as knowledge
objects, the different categories of expertise that exist within that organization
(e.g., ﬁnancial analysis). These attributes are used to search for, select, and
retrieve speciﬁc knowledgeable individuals within the company.
The structure for the repository further includes schemes for labeling, index-
ing, linking, and cross-referencing the information units that together comprise
the content of KM. Although the Meyer and Zack key cycle addresses infor-
mation products, the approach can easily be extended to knowledge products.
Knowledge does indeed possess unique attributes, but this does not mean we
should adopt a tabula rasa approach and reinvent a decade’s worth of tried,
tested, and true methods and approaches to content management. This is par-
ticularly true of explicit, formal, and codiﬁed knowledge where this type of
knowledge follows mostly similar processes as information products do in
general. In the case of tacit knowledge, content management approaches need
to be further adapted, but once again, solid content management should serve
as a point of departure.
The repository becomes the foundation upon which a ﬁrm creates its family
of information and knowledge products. This means that the greater the scope,
depth, and complexity, the greater the ﬂexibility for deriving products and thus
the greater the potential variety within the product family. Such repositories
often form the ﬁrst kernel of an organizational memory or corporate memory
for the company. A sample repository for a railway administration organiza-
tion is shown in Figure 2-1. 
Meyer and Zack analyzed the major developmental stages of a knowledge
repository and mapped these stages onto a KM cycle. The stages are acquisi-
tion, reﬁnement, storage/retrieval, distribution, and presentation/use. They
refer to this cycle as the “reﬁnery.” Figures 2-2 and 2-3 summarize the major
stages in the Meyer and Zack cycle.
Acquisition of data or information addresses the issues regarding sources of
“raw” materials such as scope, breadth, depth, credibility, accuracy, timeliness,
relevance, cost, control, and exclusivity. The guiding principle is the well-
known adage of “garbage in, garbage out.” That is, source data must be of
the highest quality; otherwise the intellectual products produced downstream
will be inferior.
Reﬁnement is the primary source of value added; it may be physical (e.g.,
migrating from one medium to another) or logical (restructuring, relabeling,
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CYCLE 29
indexing, and integrating.) Reﬁning also refers to cleaning up (e.g., “sanitiz-
ing” content so as to ensure complete anonymity of sources and key players
involved) or standardizing (e.g., conforming to templates of a best practice or
lessons learned as used within that particular organization). Statistical analy-
ses can be performed on content at this stage to conduct a meta-analysis (high-
level summary of key themes and patterns found in a collection of knowledge
objects). This stage of the Meyer and Zack cycle adds value by creating more
readily usable knowledge objects and by storing the content more ﬂexibly for
future use.

Storage Retrieval
Storage/retrieval forms a bridge between the upstream acquisition and reﬁne-
ment stages that feed the repository and downstream stages of product gen-
eration. Storage may be physical (ﬁle folders, printed information) or digital
(database, knowledge management software).
Distribution describes how the product is delivered to the end user (e.g., fax,
print, e-mail) and encompasses not only the medium of delivery but also its
timing, frequency, form, language, and so on.
The ﬁnal step is presentation or use. It is at this stage that context plays an
important role. The effectiveness of each of the preceding value-added steps is
evaluated here: does the user have enough context to be able to make use of
this content? If not, the KM cycle has failed to deliver value to the individual
and ultimately to the organization.
In order for the cycle to work as intended, front-end knowledge needs to be
provided. This is typically in the form of rules in how to identify source infor-
mation, acquire it, reﬁne it, and subsequently add it to the ﬁrm’s information
repository. There may also be a similar need at the ﬁnal stage—rules on how
content may be distributed and used such as copyright, attribution, conﬁden-
tiality, and other restrictions that may apply.
The repository and the “reﬁnery” together enable the management of valu-
able knowledge of a ﬁrm. They in turn need to be supported by the ﬁrm’s core
capabilities in information technology, internal knowledge about its business,
external knowledge about current and emerging environments, as well as how

it organizes and manages itself. The ﬂexibility with which the ﬁrm can create
content-based products forms the basis of the ﬁrm’s ability to realize market
leverage from its information assets.
Although not explicitly described in the Meyer and Zack cycle, there is also
a notion of having to continually renew the repository and the reﬁnery in order
to avoid obsolescence. Renewal should be added to the cycle diagram in the
form of a feedback loop that involves rethinking the basic content and struc-
ture of the repository to decide whether different, newer products or repack-
aging is required. This may mean increasing the depth of an analysis, updating
a report, providing greater integration, allowing more sophisticated cross-
linking, or achieving greater standardization of content.
The Meyer and Zack model is one of the most complete descriptions of the
key elements involved in the knowledge management model. Its strength
derives primarily from its comprehensive information processing paradigm,
which is almost completely adaptable to knowledge-based content. In partic-
ular, the notion of reﬁnement is a crucial stage in the KM cycle and one that
is often neglected.
The Bukowitz and Williams KM Cycle
Bukowitz and Williams (2000) describe a knowledge management process
framework (p. 9) that outlines “how organizations generate, maintain and
deploy a strategically correct stock of knowledge to create value” (p. 8). This
framework is shown in Figure 2-4.
In this framework, knowledge consists of knowledge repositories, relation-
ships, information technologies, communications infrastructure, functional
skill sets, process know-how, environmental responsiveness, organizational
intelligence, and external sources. The get, learn, and contribute phases are tac-
tical in nature. They are triggered by market-driven opportunities or demands,
and they typically result in day-to-day use of knowledge to respond to these
demands. The assess, build/sustain, or divest stages are more strategic, trig-
gered by shifts in the macroenvironment. These stages focus on more long-
range processes of matching intellectual capital to strategic requirements.
The ﬁrst stage, get, consists of seeking out information needed in order to
make decisions, solve problems, or innovate. The challenge today is not so

much in ﬁnding information but in dealing effectively with the enormous
volume of information that can be obtained. Technology has made great strides
in providing access to an ever-increasing pool of information. The resultant
“information overload” has created a critical need to sift through the vast
volume of content, identify the knowledge of value, and then to manage this
knowledge effectively and efﬁciently. Information professionals have tradi-
tionally fulﬁlled this role, and they are certainly needed, now more than ever.
User needs must be well understood in order to match information seekers with
the best possible content. This involves knowing where knowledge resources
exist and can be accessed.
Where knowledge management diverges from information management is
that “getting” of content encompasses not only traditional explicit content
(e.g., a physical or electronic document) but also tacit knowledge. This means
information users need be connected not only to content but also to content
experts—people—where most of the valuable tacit knowledge resides. The
term cybrarian is sometimes used to describe the new knowledge profes-
sional role. The key tasks are to organize knowledge content, maintain timeli-
ness, completeness, and accuracy, proﬁle users’ information needs, access/
navigate/ﬁlter voluminous content in order to respond to users’ needs, and help
train users with new knowledge repository technologies (information literacy).
The next stage, use, deals with how to combine information in new and
interesting ways in order to foster organizational innovation. The focus is pri-
marily on individuals and then on groups. The narrow focus on innovation as
the reason for making use of intellectual assets is somewhat limiting in this
KM cycle. The authors discuss a number of techniques to promote serendip-
ity and out-of-the-box thinking or creativity-enhancing techniques. Although
promoting the greatest, most ﬂuid ﬂow of knowledge is a worthwhile pursuit,
the uses of knowledge are much wider in scope than innovation.
The learn stage refers to the formal process of learning from experiences 
as a means of creating competitive advantage. An organizational memory is
created so that organizational learning becomes possible from both successes
(best practices) and failures (lessons learned). The links between learning and
creating value are harder to establish than those of getting and using infor-
mation. Learning in organizations is important because it represents the tran-
sition step between the application of ideas and the generation of new ones.
Time must be taken to reﬂect on experience and consider its possible value
elsewhere. There should be a strong link between organizational strategy and
organizational learning activities. Learning is absolutely essential after the
“getting” and “using” of content; otherwise, the content is simply warehoused
somewhere and does not make a difference in how things are done within the
organization.
The contribute stage of the KM cycle deals with getting employees to post
what they have learned to the communal knowledge base (e.g., a repository).
Only in this way can individual knowledge be made visible and available across
the entire organization, where appropriate. The last caveat is added, for the
tendency is to warehouse all knowledge, which should not be the focus of KM.
These sequences of steps are used by many authors, and they have the unfor-
tunate effect of creating the misconception that KM is all about making public
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CYCLE 33
all that resides within the heads of individuals. Needless to say, the impact on
the motivation of employees plummets considerably! The point of the exercise
is not to post everything on the company intranet but to cull those experiences
from which others in the organization may also beneﬁt. This implies that the
experience has potential to be generalized. In fact, a great deal of content to
be shared organization-wide must ﬁrst be repackaged in a “generic” format in
order to be of use to a wider audience.
Examples of content that employees should be encouraged to contribute
include the sharing of best practices and lessons learned so that others do not
repeat the same mistakes. The authors describe a number of carrots and sticks
that can be used to promote knowledge sharing. In effect, practice has proven
that knowledge sharing occurs quite well without any heavy direct pay-per-
contribution schemes, or with equally onerous punish-the-withholders men-
tality. In order for successful knowledge sharing to occur, it must “make sense.”
That is, the beneﬁts to both the organization and the individuals must exist
and must be clearly perceived as such. The other critical success factor appears
to involve the successful deployment of knowledge brokers—professionals who
assume the responsibility of gathering, repackaging, and promoting knowledge
nuggets throughout the organization. A good system should be in place to
maintain the results of organizational learning—a good organizational memory
management system, often in the form of an intranet of some sort. Part of good
organizational memory management practice should be to always maintain
attribution, require authorization for dissemination, provide feedback mecha-
nisms, and keep track of knowledge reuse. One of the best rewards of con-
tributing is to be notiﬁed of how “popular” your contributions were (which is
analogous to a citation index for scholarly publications).
Next, the assess stage deals more with the group and organizational level.
Assessment refers to the evaluation of intellectual capital and requires that the
organization deﬁne mission-critical knowledge and map current intellectual
capital against future knowledge needs. The organization must also develop
metrics to demonstrate that it is growing its knowledge base and proﬁting 
from its investments in intellectual capital. The theory of the organization
needs to be expanded to include capturing the impact of knowledge on orga-
nizational performance. This includes identifying new forms of capital such as
human capital (competencies), customer capital (the customer relationship),
organizational capital (knowledge bases, business processes, technology infra-
structure, values, norms, and culture), and intellectual capital (the relationship
between human, customer, and organizational capital). Assessment must take
these new types of assets into account and focus on how easily and ﬂexibly 
the organization can convert its knowledge into products and services of value
to the customer. A new set of frameworks, processes, and metrics that evalu-
ate the knowledge base must be incorporated into the overall management
process.
The build and sustain step in the KM cycle ensures that the organization’s
future intellectual capital will keep the organization viable and competitive.
Resources must be allocated to the growth and maintenance of knowledge, and
they should be channeled in such a way as to create new knowledge and rein-
force existing knowledge. At the tactical level, the inability to locate and apply
34 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
knowledge to meet an existing need results in a lost opportunity. At the 
strategic level, coming up short on the “right” knowledge delivers a much 
more serious blow—loss of competitiveness and ultimately of organizational
viability as well.
The ﬁnal step in the Bukowitz and Williams KM cycle is the divest step. The
organization should not hold on to assets—physical or intellectual—if they are
no longer creating value. In fact, some knowledge may be more valuable if it
is transferred outside the organization. In this step of the KM cycle, organiza-
tions need to examine their intellectual capital in terms of the resources
required to maintain it and whether these resources would be better spent else-
where. This involves understanding the why, when, where, and how of for-
mally divesting parts of the knowledge base. An opportunity cost analysis of
retaining knowledge should be incorporated into standard management 
practice. It is necessary to be able to understand which parts of the knowledge
base will be unnecessary for sustaining competitive advantage and industry 
viability.
Traditional divestiture decisions regarding knowledge include obtaining
patents, spinning off companies, outsourcing work, terminating a training
program and/or employees, replacing/upgrading technologies, and ending part-
nerships, alliances, or contracts. However, KM requires a planned purposeful
form of divesting, which means that the decision to be made is a strategic one,
not an operational task. Ideally, unnecessary knowledge should not have been
acquired in the ﬁrst place; the organization should put into place processes to
clearly discriminate between forms of knowledge that can be leveraged and
those that are of limited use. Knowledge that is a drain on resources should
be converted into value. This often involves converting rather than getting rid
of knowledge—for example, by redeploying the knowledge elsewhere within
or outside of the organization.
The Bukowitz and Williams KM cycle introduces two new critical phases:
the learning of knowledge content and the decision as to whether to maintain
this knowledge or divest the organization of this knowledge content. This KM
cycle is more comprehensive than the Meyer and Zack cycle because the notion
of tacit as well as explicit knowledge management has been incorporated.
The McElroy KM Cycle
McElroy (1999) describes a knowledge life cycle that consists of the pro-
cesses of knowledge production and knowledge integration, with a series 
of feedback loops to organizational memory, beliefs, and claims and 
the business-processing environment. The high-level processes are shown in 
Figure 2-5.
McElroy emphasizes that organizational knowledge is held both subjectively
in the minds of individuals and groups and objectively in explicit forms.
Together, they comprise the distributed organizational knowledge base of the
company. Knowledge use in the business-processing environment results in out-
comes that either match expectations or fail to do so. Matches reinforce exist-
ing knowledge, leading to its reuse, whereas mismatches lead to adjustments
in business-processing behavior via single-loop learning (Argyris and Schon,
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CYCLE 35
1978). Successive failures from mismatches will lead to doubt and ultimately
rejection of existing knowledge, which will in turn trigger knowledge process-
ing to produce and integrate new knowledge, this time via double-loop learn-
ing (Argyris and Schon, 1978).
Problem claim formulation represents an attempt to learn and state the spe-
ciﬁc nature of the detected knowledge gap. Knowledge claim formulation
follows as a response to validated problem claims via information acquisition
and individual and group learning. New knowledge claims are tested and eval-
uated via knowledge claim evaluation processes. Evaluation of knowledge
claims leads to surviving knowledge claims that will be integrated as new orga-
nizational knowledge or falsiﬁed/undecided knowledge claims. The record of
all such outcomes becomes part of the distributed organizational knowledge
base via knowledge integration. Once integrated, they are used in business pro-
cessing. Experience gained from the use of knowledge in the organizational
knowledge base gives rise to new claims and resulting beliefs, triggering the
cycle to begin all over again.
In knowledge production, the key processes are individual and group learn-
ing; knowledge claim formulation; information acquisition; codiﬁed knowl-
edge claim; and knowledge claim evaluation. Figure 2-6 illustrates these
knowledge production processes.
Individual and group learning represents the ﬁrst step in organizational
learning. Knowledge is information until it is validated. Knowledge claim val-
idation involves codiﬁcation at an organizational level. A formalized procedure
is required for the receipt and codiﬁcation of individual and group innovations.
Information acquisition is the process by which an organization deliberately
or serendipitously acquires knowledge claims or information produced by
others, usually external to the organization. This stage plays a fundamental
role in formulating new knowledge claims at the organizational level. Exam-

are evaluated to determine their veracity and value. This implies that they 
are of greater value than existing knowledge in the organizational knowledge
base. Figure 2-7 shows some of the components of this stage of the knowledge
cycle.

Knowledge integration is the process by which an organization introduces
new knowledge claims to its operating environment and retires old ones. This
includes all knowledge transmission such as teaching, knowledge sharing, and
other social activities that either communicate an understanding of previously
produced organizational knowledge to knowledge workers or integrate newly
minted knowledge. Figure 2-8 describes this stage of the KM cycle.
One of the great strengths of the McElroy cycle is the clear description of
how knowledge is evaluated and a conscious decision is made as to whether
or not it will be integrated into the organizational memory. The validation of
knowledge is a step that clearly distinguishes knowledge management from
document management. The KM cycle does more than address the storage and
subsequent management of documents or knowledge that has been warehoused
“as is.” The KM cycle focuses on processes to identify knowledge content that
is of value to the organization and its employees.
The Wiig KM Cycle
Wiig (1993) focuses on the three conditions that need to be present for an
organization to conduct its business successfully: it must have a business 
(products/services) and customers; it must have resources (people, capital, and
facilities); and it must have the ability to act. The third point is emphasized in
the Wiig KM cycle.
Knowledge is the principal force that determines and drives the ability to act
intelligently. With improved knowledge we know better what to do and how
to do it. Wiig identiﬁes the major purpose of KM as an effort “to make the
enterprise intelligent-acting by facilitating the creation, cumulation [ sic],
deployment and use of quality knowledge” (p. 39). Working smarter means

that we must approach our tasks with greater expertise—that we must acquire
as much relevant and high-quality knowledge as possible and apply it better
in a number of different ways. Working smarter “involves making use of all
the best knowledge we have available” (p. 51).
Wiig’s KM cycle addresses how knowledge is built and used as individuals
or as organizations. There are four major steps in this cycle, as shown in Figure
2-9:
1. Building knowledge.
2. Holding knowledge.
3. Pooling knowledge.
4. Applying knowledge.
Although the steps are shown to be independent and sequential, this is a 
simpliﬁcation since we may perform some of the functions and activities in
parallel. It is also possible to cycle back to repeat functions and activities per-
formed earlier but with a different emphasis and/or level of detail. The cycle
addresses a broad range of learning from all types of sources: personal expe-
rience, formal education or training, peers, and intelligence from all sources.
We can then hold knowledge either within our heads or in tangible forms such
as books or databases. Knowledge can be pooled and used in a variety of dif-
ferent ways depending on the context and the purpose.
The cycle focuses on identifying and relating the functions and activities that
we engage in to make products and services as knowledge workers.

Building knowledge refers to activities ranging from market research to focus
groups, surveys, competitive intelligence, and data mining applications. Build-
ing knowledge consists of ﬁve major activities:
1. Obtain knowledge.
2. Analyze knowledge.
3. Reconstruct/synthesize knowledge.
4. Codify and model knowledge.
5. Organize knowledge.
Knowledge creation may occur through R&D projects, innovations by indi-
viduals to improve the way they perform their tasks, experimentation, rea-
soning with existing knowledge, and hiring of new people. Knowledge may
also be created through knowledge importing (e.g., elicit knowledge from
experts and from procedure manuals, engage in joint ventures to obtain tech-
nology, or transfer people between departments). Finally, knowledge may be
created through observing the real world (e.g., making site visits, observing
processes after the introduction of a change).
Knowledge analysis consists of:
I Extracting what appears to be knowledge from obtained material (e.g.,
analyze transcripts and identify themes, listen to an explanation, and select
concepts for further consideration).
I Abstracting extracted materials (e.g., form a model or a theory).
I Identifying patterns extracted (e.g., trend analysis).
I Explaining relations between knowledge fragments (e.g., compare and con-
trast, causal relations).
I Verifying that extracted materials correspond to the meaning of original
sources (e.g., meaning has not been corrupted through summarizing, collat-
ing, and so on).
Knowledge synthesis or reconstruction consists of generalizing analyzed
material to obtain broader principles, generating hypotheses to explain obser-
vations, establishing conformance between new and existing knowledge (e.g.,
corroborating validity in light of what is already known), and updating the
total knowledge pool by incorporating the new knowledge.
Codifying and modeling knowledge involves how we represent knowl-
edge in our minds (mental models, for example), how we then assemble the
knowledge into a coherent model, how we document the knowledge in books
and manuals, and how we encode it in order to post it to a knowledge 
repository.
Finally, knowledge is organized for speciﬁc uses and according to an estab-
lished organizational framework (such as standards and categories). Examples
include a help desk service or a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on
the company intranet. This organization is usually done using some form of
knowledge ontology (conceptual model) and taxonomy (classiﬁcation rules).
Examples include an ofﬁcial list of key words or categories, knowledge object
attribute speciﬁcations, and guidelines for translation.
40 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
Holding knowledge consists of remembering, accumulating knowledge in
repositories, embedding knowledge in repositories, and archiving knowledge.
Remembering knowledge means that the individual has retained or remem-
bered that item of knowledge (i.e., knowledge has been internalized or under-
stood by a given individual). Accumulating knowledge in a repository means
that a computer-resident knowledge base has been created and that knowledge
has been encoded, permitting it to be stored in organizational memory. Embed-
ding knowledge consists of ensuring that it is part of business procedures (e.g.,
added to a procedures manual or training course). Finally, archiving knowl-
edge involves creating a scientiﬁc library and systematically retiring out-
of-date, false, or no longer relevant knowledge from the active repository.
Archiving typically involves storing the content in another, less costly, or less
bulky medium for less frequent future retrieval.
Examples of knowledge held by companies include intellectual property,
patents, knowledge documented in the form of research reports, technical
papers, or tacit knowledge, which remains in the minds of individuals but
which may be elicited and embedded in the knowledge base or repository (e.g.,
tips, tricks of the trade, case studies, videotapes of demonstrations by experts,
and task support systems). In this way, the organization’s holdings of valuable
knowledge are documented in repositories or in people and are therefore avail-
able for future reference and use.
Knowledge pooling consists of coordinating, assembling, and accessing and
retrieving knowledge. Coordination of knowledge typically requires the for-
mation of collaborative teams to work with particular content in order to
create a “who knows what” network. Once knowledge sources are identiﬁed,
they are then assembled into background references for a library or repository
in order to facilitate subsequent access and retrieval. Focus groups are often
used in order to arrive at a consensus as to how this can best be achieved.
Access and retrieval then addresses being able to consult with knowledgeable
people about difﬁcult problems, obtaining a second opinion from an expert,
or discussing a difﬁcult case with a peer. Knowledge can be accessed and
retrieved directly from the repository as well (e.g., using a knowledge base
system to obtain advice on how to do something or reading a knowledge doc-
ument in order to arrive at a decision).
Organizations may pool knowledge in a variety of ways. The employee who
does not have the necessary knowledge and know-how to solve a particular
problem can contact others in the organization who have solved similar prob-
lems either by obtaining the information from the organizational knowledge
repository or by ﬁnding an expert through the expertise locator network and
contacting that person directly. The individual can then organize all this infor-
mation and request that more experienced knowledge workers validate the
content.
Finally, there are innumerable ways to apply the knowledge, including the
following:
I Use established knowledge to perform a routine task—for example, make
standard products, provide a standard service, or use the expert network to
ﬁnd out who is knowledgeable about a particular area.
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CYCLE 41
I Use general knowledge to survey exceptional situations at hand—
for example, determine what the problem is and estimate potential 
consequences.
I Use knowledge to describe the situation and scope of the problem—for
example, identify the problem and show generally how to handle it.
I Select relevant special knowledge to handle the situation—for example, 
identify who you need to consult with or want to address the problem.
I Observe and characterize the situation with special knowledge—for
example, make a comparison with known patterns, take a history, and
collect and organize required information to act.
I Analyze the situation with knowledge—for example, judge whether it can
be handled internally or whether outside help will be required.
I Synthesize alternative solutions with knowledge—for example, identify
options and outline possible approaches.
I Evaluate potential alternatives using special knowledge—for example, deter-
mine the risks and beneﬁts of each possible approach.
I Use knowledge to decide what to do—for example, rank alternatives, select
one, and do a reality check.
I Implement the selected alternative—for example, execute the task and
authorize the team to proceed.
When knowledge is applied to work objects, routine and standard tasks are
approached in a different way than difﬁcult or unusual tasks. Routine or stan-
dard tasks are typically carried out using “compiled” knowledge that we can
readily access and use almost unconsciously or automatically. Difﬁcult tasks
are usually performed in a more deliberate and conscious manner, for knowl-
edge workers cannot use automated knowledge in unanticipated situations.
Figure 2-10 summarizes the key activities in the Wiig KM cycle. A major
advantage of the Wiig approach to the KM cycle is the clear and detailed
description of how organizational memory is put into use in order to generate
value for individuals, groups, and the organization itself. The myriad of ways
in which knowledge can be applied and used are linked to decision-making
sequences and individual characteristics. Wiig also emphasizes the role of

AN INTEGRATED KM CYCLE
On the basis of our preceding study of some major approaches to KM cycles,
we can distill an integrated KM cycle. The three major stages are:
1. Knowledge capture and/or creation.
2. Knowledge sharing and dissemination.
3. Knowledge acquisition and application.
In the transition from knowledge capture/creation to knowledge sharing and
dissemination, knowledge content is assessed. Knowledge is then contextual-
ized in order to be understood (“acquisition”) and used (“application”). This
stage then feeds back into the ﬁrst one in order to update the knowledge
content. The integrated KM cycle is outlined in Figure 2-11.
Knowledge capture refers to the identiﬁcation and subsequent codiﬁcation
of existing (usually previously unnoticed) internal knowledge and know-how
within the organization and/or external knowledge from the environment.
Knowledge creation is the development of new knowledge and know-how—
innovations that did not have a previous existence within the company. When
knowledge is inventoried in this manner, the next critical step is to present an
assessment against selection criteria that will follow closely the organizational
goals. Is this content valid? Is it new or better? That is, is it of sufﬁcient value
to the organization such that it should be added to the store of intellectual
capital?

Once it has been decided that the new or newly identiﬁed content is of suf-
ﬁcient value, the next step is to contextualize this content. This involves main-
taining a link between the knowledge and those knowledgeable about that
content: the author or originator of the idea and subject matter experts, as well
as those who have garnered signiﬁcant experience in making use of this
content. Contextualization also implies identifying the key attributes of the
content in order to better match to a variety of users—for example, personal-
ization to translate the content into one preferred by the end user or creation
of a short executive summary to better accommodate the time constraints of
a senior manager. Finally, contextualization will often succeed when the new
content is ﬁrmly, yet seamlessly, embedded in the business processes of the
organization. The integrated cycle subsumes most of the steps involved in the
KM cycles discussed in this chapter. Table 2-2 shows this mapping in more
detail.
The knowledge management cycle is then reiterated as users understand 
and decide to make use of content. The users will validate usefulness, and 
they will signal when it becomes out of date or when this knowledge is not
applicable. Users will help validate the scope of the content or how generaliz-
able the best practices and lessons learned can be. They will also, quite often,
come up with new content, which they can then contribute to the next cycle
iteration.

STRA TEGIC IMPLICA TIONS OF THE 
KM CYCLE
Knowledge represents the decisive basis for intelligent, competent behavior
at the individual, group, and organization level. Only a conscious and orga-
nized reﬂection of lessons learned and best practices discovered will allow com-
panies to leverage their hard-won knowledge assets. A knowledge architecture
needs to be designed and implemented in order to enable the staged process-
ing and transformation of knowledge, much like information products are
processed, and to ensure that the knowledge objects reach intended end users
and are put to good use. The objective is to retain and share knowledge with
a wider audience. Information and communication technologies such as group-
ware, intranets, and knowledge bases or repositories provide the necessary
infrastructure to do so. Business processes and cultural enablers offer the nec-
essary incentives and opportunities for all knowledge workers to become active
participants throughout the knowledge management cycle.
PRACTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS FOR 
MANAGING KNOWLEDGE
Understanding the different stages of managing knowledge throughout the
KM cycle is important, though not enough. From a practical perspective, man-
aging knowledge requires an organizing principle—a framework—that will
help us classify the different types of activities and functions needed to deal
with all knowledge-related work within and between organizations. This
framework is often encapsulated in the form of a KM theory or model. Several
major KM models are presented in the next chapter.
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CYCLE 45
EXAMPLE
A major international consulting organization wanted to capture lessons
learned from its major projects. This represented a ﬁrst step toward becom-
ing a learning organization. From a scan of what similar companies were
doing, their competitive intelligence led them to select the implementation
of an after-action review (AAR) in the form of a project postmortem. The
AAR was a new procedure, and it was initially piloted with a group of expe-
rienced consultants. Project managers who became experienced with the
postmortem were subsequently asked to become resource people for those
willing to learn and try it out. A new role of knowledge journalist was
created; the idea was to appoint a neutral, objective person who had not
been a member of the original project team to facilitate the postmortem
process and capture the key learnings from the project. Finally, the post-
mortem was added as a ﬁnal step for all project managers before they could
ofﬁcially and formally deem a project to be completed.
KEY POINTS
I There are a number of different approaches to the knowledge management
cycle such as those by McElroy, Wiig, Bukowitz and Willams, and Meyer
and Zack.
I By comparing and contrasting these approaches and by validating them
through experience gained to date with KM practice, the major stages are
identiﬁed as knowledge capture and creation, knowledge sharing and dis-
semination, and knowledge acquisition and application.
I The critical processes throughout the KM cycle assess the worth of content
based on organizational goals, contextualize content in order to better match
with a variety of users, and continuously update with a focus on updating,
archiving as required, and modifying the scope of each knowledge object.
DISCUSSION POINTS
1. Discuss the different KM cycle approaches and how to integrate them
into a comprehensive, integrated approach to the effective management
of knowledge within an organization.
2. Provide an example of how each major KM cycle stage listed below can
add value to knowledge and increase the strategic worth of the knowl-
edge asset:
a. Capture
b. Codify
c. Create
d. Share
e. Acquire
f. Apply
3. Where are the key decision points in the KM cycle? What types of infor-
mation would you require in order to decide whether the knowledge
content would continue to the next step of the cycle?

Furious activity is no substitute for understanding.
H. H. Williams (1858–1940)
To succeed, a knowledge management initiative must have a robust theo-
retical foundation. The major KM activities described in the KM cycle in the
previous chapter require a conceptual framework to operate within; otherwise
the activities will not be coordinated and will not produce the expected KM
beneﬁts. Knowledge management models are presented from Choo (1998),
Weick (2001), Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), Wiig (1993), von Krogh and
Roos (1995), Boisot (1998), Beer (1984), and Bennet and Bennet (2004). All
the models present different perspectives on the key conceptual elements that
form the infrastructure of knowledge management. This chapter describes,
compares, and contrasts each model in order to provide a sound understand-
ing of the discipline of KM.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Understand the key tenets of the major knowledge management theo-
retical models in use today.
2. Link the KM frameworks to key KM concepts and the major phases of
the KM cycle.
3. Explain the complex adaptive system model of KM and how it addresses
the subjective and dynamic nature of content to be managed.
INTRODUCTION
In an economy where the only certainty is uncertainty, 
the one sure source of lasting competitive advantage is knowledge.
I. Nonaka (1995)
Although few would argue that knowledge is not important, the overriding
problem is that few managers and information professionals understand how
to manage knowledge in knowledge-creating organizations. The tendency is to
focus on “hard” or quantiﬁable knowledge, and KM is often seen as some sort
of information processing machine. The advent of knowledge management was
initially met with a fair degree of criticism, with many people feeling this was
yet another buzzword that would quickly pass into history. Instead, KM estab-
lished itself credibly as both an academic discipline of study and a professional
ﬁeld of practice, and one reason it was so successful was the work done on
theoretical or conceptual models of knowledge management. Early in the devel-
opment of KM, more pragmatic considerations about its processes were soon
complemented by the need to understand what was happening in organiza-
tional knowing, reasoning, and learning.
A more holistic approach to KM has become necessary as the complex sub-
jective and dynamic nature of knowledge has become a more pressing issue.
Cultural and contextual inﬂuences further increased the complexity involved
in KM, and these factors also had to be taken into account in a model or frame-
work that could situate and explain the key KM concepts and processes.
Finally, measurements were needed in order to be able to monitor progress
toward and attainment of expected KM beneﬁts.
This holistic approach encompasses all the different types of content to be
managed, ranging from data to information to knowledge, but also from tacit
to explicit and back to tacit-knowledge-type conversions. All the KM models
presented in this chapter attempt to address knowledge management from a
holistic and comprehensive perspective.
Davenport and Prusak (1998, p. 2) provide the following distinctions
between data, information, and knowledge, which also serve to recap the
examples presented in Chapter 1:
Data: A set of discrete, objective facts about events.
Information: A message, usually in the form of a document or an audible or visible
communication.
Knowledge: A ﬂuid mix of framed experiences, values, contextual information,
and expert insight that provides a framework for evaluating and incor-
porating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied
in the minds of knowers. In organizations, it often becomes embed-
ded not only in documents or repositories but also in organizational
routines, processes, practices, and norms.
Davenport and Prusak (1998) refer to this distinction between data, infor-
mation, and knowledge as an operational one, and they argue that we can
transform information into knowledge by means of comparison, consequences,
48 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
connections, and conversation. They stress that knowledge-creating activities
take place between and within humans and that we have to consider knowl-
edge among the most important corporate assets.
Yet there is no need to choose one over the other or to create mutually exclu-
sive categories. A great deal of overlap and a great deal of value are evident
in the many different types of content. In this respect, content management is
perhaps a better, more general term than knowledge management.
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) provide a more philosophical distinction, start-
ing from the traditional deﬁnition of knowledge as “justiﬁed true belief.” They
deﬁne knowledge as “a dynamic human process of justifying personal belief
toward the “truth” (p. 58). They contend that in order to produce innovation,
it is necessary to create knowledge. For them, organizational knowledge cre-
ation is “the capability of a company as a whole to create new knowledge, 
disseminate it throughout the organization and embody it in products, 
services, and systems” (p. 58).
The concept of tacit knowledge, as we saw in Chapter 1, has been clariﬁed
by Polanyi (1966), who stresses the importance of the “personal” way of
knowledge construction, affected by emotions and acquired at the end of the
process involving every individual’s active creation and organization of the
experiences. When a person tacitly knows, he or she acts, decides, uses the
body, and experiences great difﬁculty in explaining this process in words, rules,
and algorithms. The act of tacitly knowing is without distance from things and
performances, and the knowing interaction between persons is one of an
unaware observation and social, “communitarian” closeness.
Polanyi posits that all knowledge is either tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge.
On one hand, tacit knowledge is not easily expressed in formalized ways, and
is context-speciﬁc, personal, and difﬁcult to communicate. On the other hand,
explicit knowledge is the codiﬁed one, expressed in formal and linguistic ways,
easily transmittable and storable, and expressible in words and algorithms, but
it represents only the tip of the iceberg of the entire body of knowledge. This
deﬁnition of the tacit/explicit concepts emphasizes the importance of consid-
ering adequately the tacit dimension.
The 80/20 rule appears to apply here; that is, roughly 80% of our knowl-
edge is in tacit form as individuals, as groups, and as an organization. Only
15 to 20% of valuable knowledge has typically been captured, codiﬁed, or ren-
dered tangible and concrete in some fashion. This is usually in the form of
books, databases, audio or video recordings, graphs or other images, and so
forth. The tacit/explicit mobilization (in the epistemological dimension) and
the individual/group/organizational sharing and diffusion (in the ontological
dimension) have to take place in order to create knowledge and produce inno-
vation. Each of the KM models presented in the next section addresses this
point in different but complementary ways.
MAJOR THEORETICAL KM MODELS
The following models were selected because they possess the following cri-
tical characteristics:
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT MODELS 49
1. They represent a holistic approach to knowledge management (i.e., they
are comprehensive and take into consideration people, process, orga-
nization, and technology dimensions).
2. They have been reviewed, critiqued, and discussed extensively in the KM
literature, by practitioners, academics, and researchers alike.
3. The models have been implemented and ﬁeld tested with respect to reli-
ability and validity.
This list is not meant either to be exhaustive or a deﬁnitive short list, but the
models have been selected with a view to providing the widest possible 
perspective on KM as a whole, combined with a deeper, more robust theoret-
ical foundation for explaining, describing, and better predicting the best way
to manage knowledge.
The von Krogh and Roos Model of 
Organizational Epistemology
The von Krogh and Roos KM model (1995) distinguishes between indivi-
dual knowledge and social knowledge, and they take an epistemological
approach to managing organizational knowledge: the organizational episte-
mology KM model. Whereas the deﬁnition of organization has been problem-
atic and the term is often used interchangeably with information, a number of
issues must be addressed:
I How and why individuals within an organization come to know.
I How and why organizations, as social entities, come to know.
I What counts for knowledge of the individual and the organization.
I What are the impediments in organizational KM.
The cognitivist perspective (e.g., Varela, 1992) proposes that a cognitive
system, whether it is a human brain or a computer, creates representations (i.e.,
models) of reality and that learning occurs when these representations are
manipulated. A cognitive organizational epistemology views organizational
knowledge as a self-organizing system in which humans are transparent to the
information from the outside (i.e., we take in information through our senses,
and we use this information to build our mental models). The brain is a
machine based on logic and deduction that does not allow any contradictory
propositions. The organization thus picks up information from its environment
and processes it in a logical way. Alternative courses of action are generated
through information search, and the cognitive competence of an organization
depends on the mobilization of individual cognitive resources—a “linear” sum-
mation of individuals to form the organizational whole.
The connectionist approach, on the other hand, is more holistic than reduc-
tionist. The brain is not assumed to sequentially process symbols but to per-
ceive “wholeness,” global properties, patterns, synergies, and gestalts. Learning
rules govern how the various components of these whole networks are con-
nected. Information is not only taken in from the environment but also gen-
erated internally. Familiarity and practice lead to learning. Individuals form
50 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
nodes in a loosely connected organizational system, and knowledge is an emer-
gent phenomenon that stems from the social interactions of these individuals.
In this perspective, knowledge resides not only in the minds of individuals but
also in the connections among these individuals. A collective mind is formed
as the representation of this network, and it is this that lies at the core of orga-
nizational knowledge management.
Von Krogh and Roos adopt the connectionist approach. In their organiza-
tional epistemology KM model, knowledge resides both in the individuals of
an organization and, at the social level, in the relations between the individu-
als. Knowledge is said to be “embodied”; that is, “everything known is known
by somebody” (von Krogh and Roos, 1995, p. 50). Unlike cognitivism, which
views knowledge as an abstract entity, connectionism maintains that there can
be no knowledge without a knower. This notion ﬁts nicely with the concept of
tacit knowledge, which is very difﬁcult to abstract out of someone and is made
more concrete. It also reinforces the strong need to maintain links between
knowledge objects and those who are knowledgeable about them—authors,
subject matter experts, and experienced users who have applied the knowledge
both successfully and unsuccessfully.
In 1998, von Krogh, Roos, and Kleine examined the fragile nature of KM
in organizations in terms of the mind-set of the individuals, communication in
the organization, the organizational structure, the relationship between the
members, and the management of human resources. These ﬁve factors could
impede the successful management of organizational knowledge for innova-
tion, competitive advantage, and other organizational goals. For example, 
if the individuals do not perceive knowledge to be a crucial competence of 
the ﬁrm, then the organization will have trouble developing knowledge-based
competencies. If there is no legitimate language to express new knowledge in
the individual, contributions will fail. If the organizational structure does not
facilitate innovation, KM will fail. If individual members are not eager to share
their experiences with their colleagues on the basis of mutual trust and respect,
there will be no generation of social, collective knowledge within that organi-
zation. Finally, if those contributing knowledge are not highly evaluated and
acknowledged by top management, they will lose their motivation to innovate
and develop new knowledge for the ﬁrm.
Organizations need to put knowledge enablers in place that will stimulate
the development of individual knowledge, group sharing of knowledge, and
organizational retention of valuable knowledge-based content. This approach
was further reﬁned (von Krogh, Ichijo, and Nonaka, 2000) to propose a model
of knowledge enabling rather than knowledge management. Knowledge
enabling refers to the “overall set of organizational activities that positively
affect knowledge creation” (p. 4). This typically involves facilitating relation-
ships and conversations as well as sharing local knowledge across an organi-
zation and across geographical and cultural borders.
The connectionist approach appears to be the more appropriate one for
underpinning a theoretical model of knowledge management, especially owing
to the fact that the linkage between knowledge and those who “absorb” and
make use of the knowledge is viewed as an unbreakable bond. The con-
nectionist approach provides a solid theoretical cornerstone for a model of
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT MODELS 51
knowledge management and is a component of the models discussed in this 
chapter.
The Nonaka and Takeuchi Knowledge Spiral Model
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) studied the success of Japanese companies in
achieving creativity and innovation. They quickly found that it was far from
a mechanistic processing of objective knowledge. Instead, they discovered 
that organizational innovation often stemmed from highly subjective insights
that can best be described in the form of metaphors, slogans, or symbols. 
The Nonaka and Takeuchi model of KM has its roots in a holistic model of
knowledge creation and the management of “serendipity.” The tacit/explicit
spectrum of knowledge forms (the epistemological dimension) and the 
individual/group/organizational or three-tier model of knowledge sharing and
diffusion (the ontological dimension) are both needed in order to create knowl-
edge and produce innovation.
Nonaka and Takeuchi argue that a key factor behind the Japanese enter-
prises’ successful track record in innovation stems from the more tacit-driven
approach to knowledge management. They maintain that Western culture con-
siders knower and known as separate entities (harkening back to the cogni-
tivist approach, which places greater importance on communicating and
storing explicit knowledge). In contrast, the Japanese, through the structural
characteristics of their language and through inﬂuences such as Zen Buddhism,
believe in the oneness of humanity and nature, body and mind, self and other
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). Accordingly, it may be easier for Japanese man-
agers to engage in the process of “indwelling,” a term used by Polanyi (1966)
to deﬁne the individual’s involvement with objects through self-involvement
and commitment, in order to create knowledge. In such a cultural environ-
ment, knowledge is principally “group knowledge,” easily converted and mobi-
lized (from tacit to explicit, along the epistemological dimension) and easily
transferred and shared (along the individual to the group to the organization,
in the ontological dimension).
Nonaka and Takeuchi underline the necessity of integrating the two
approaches, from the cultural, epistemological, and organizational points 
of view, in order to acquire new cultural and operational tools for better 
knowledge-creating organizations. Their construct of the hypertext organiza-
tion formalizes the need for integrating the traditionally opposed concepts of
Western and Japanese schools of thought.
The Knowledge Creation Process
Knowledge creation always begins with the individual. A brilliant researcher,
for example, has an insight that ultimately leads to a patent. Or a middle
manager has an intuition about market trends that becomes the catalyst for an
important new product concept. Similarly, a shop ﬂoor worker draws upon
years of experience to come up with a process innovation that saves the
company millions of dollars. In each of these scenarios, an individual’s per-
sonal, private knowledge (predominately tacit in nature) is translated into valu-
52 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
able, public organizational knowledge. Making personal knowledge available
to others in the company is at the core of this KM model. This type of knowl-
edge creation process takes place continuously and occurs at all levels of the
organization. In many cases, the creation of knowledge happens in an unex-
pected or unplanned way.
According to Nonaka and Takeuchi, there are four modes of knowledge 
conversion that
constitute the “engine” of the entire knowledge-creation process. These modes
are what the individual experiences. They are also the mechanisms by which indi-
vidual knowledge gets articulated and “ampliﬁed” into and throughout the
organization (p. 57). Organizational knowledge creation, therefore, should be
understood as a process that organizationally ampliﬁes the knowledge created 
by individuals and crystallizes it as a part of the knowledge network of the 
organization. (p. 59)
Knowledge creation consists of a social process between individuals in which
knowledge transformation is not simply a unidirectional process but it is inter-
active and spiral. (pp. 62–63)
Knowledge Conversion
There are four modes of knowledge conversion, as illustrated in Figure 3-1:
1. From tacit knowledge to tacit knowledge: the process of socialization.
2. From tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge: the process of externali-
zation.
3. From explicit knowledge to explicit knowledge: the process of com-
bination.
4. From explicit knowledge to tacit knowledge: the process of internaliza-
tion.

Socialization (tacit-to-tacit) consists of sharing knowledge in face-to-face,
natural, and typically social interactions. It involves arriving at a mutual under-
standing through the sharing of mental models, brainstorming to come up with
new ideas, apprenticeship or mentoring interactions, and so on. Socialization
is among the easiest forms of exchanging knowledge because it is what we do
instinctively when we gather at the coffee machine or engage in impromptu
corridor meetings. The greatest advantage of socialization is also its greatest
drawback: because knowledge remains tacit, it is rarely captured, noted, or
written down anywhere. It remains in the minds of the original participants.
Although socialization is a very effective means of knowledge creation and
sharing, it is one of the more limited means. It is also very difﬁcult and time-
consuming to disseminate all knowledge using only this mode.
Davenport and Prusak (1998) point out that:
Tacit, complex knowledge, developed and internalized by the knower over a
long period of time, is almost impossible to reproduce in a document or a 
database. Such knowledge incorporates so much accrued and embedded learn-
ing that its rules may be impossible to separate from how an individual acts. 
(p. 70)
This means that the process of acquiring tacit knowledge is not strictly tied to
the use of language but rather to experience and to the ability to transmit and
to share it. This idea must not be confused with that of a simple transfer of
information because knowledge creation does not take place if we abstract the
transfer of information and of experiences from associated emotions and spe-
ciﬁc contexts in which they are embedded. Socialization consists of sharing
experiences through observation, imitation, and practice.
For example, Honda organizes “brainstorming camps” during which
detailed discussions take place to solve difﬁcult problems in development proj-
ects. These informal meetings are usually held outside the workplace, off-site,
where everybody is encouraged to contribute to the discussion and nobody is
allowed to refer to the status and qualiﬁcation of employees involved. The only
behavior not admitted during these discussions is simple criticism that is not
followed by constructive suggestions. Honda uses brainstorming meetings not
only to develop new products but also to improve its managerial systems and
its commercial strategies. Brainstorming represents not only occasions for 
creative dialogue but also a moment when people share experience and, then,
tacit knowledge. In this way, they create harmony among themselves, they 
feel they are a part of the organization, and they feel linked to one another 
by sharing the same goals. Many other organizations hold similar “Knowledge
Days” or “Knowledge Cafés” to encourage this type of tacit-to-tacit knowl-
edge sharing.
The process of externalization (tacit-to-explicit) gives a visible form to tacit
knowledge and converts it to explicit knowledge. It can be deﬁned as “a quin-
tessential knowledge creation process in that tacit knowledge becomes explicit,
taking the shapes of metaphors, analogies, concepts, hypotheses, or models”
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995, p. 4). In this mode, individuals are able to arti-
culate the knowledge and know-how and, in some cases, the know-why and
54 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
the care-why. Previously tacit knowledge can be written down, taped, drawn,
or made tangible or concrete in some manner. An intermediary is often needed
at this stage; it is always more difﬁcult when we transform one type of knowl-
edge into another. A knowledge journalist is someone who can interview
knowledgeable individuals in order to extract, model, and synthesize in a dif-
ferent way (format, length, level of detail, etc.) and thereby increase its scope
(a wider audience can understand and apply this content now).
Once externalized, knowledge is tangible and permanent. It can be shared
more easily with others and leveraged throughout the organization. Good prin-
ciples of content management will need to be brought into play in order to
make future decisions about archiving, updating, and retiring externalized
knowledge content. It is particularly important not to lose attribution and
authorship information when tacit knowledge is made explicit. This involves
codifying metadata or information about the content along with the actual
content.
For example, Canon decided to design and produce a mini-copier that can
be used occasionally for personal use. This new product was very different
from expensive industrial copiers, which also engendered high maintenance
costs. Canon had to design something that was relatively inexpensive with rea-
sonable maintenance costs. The Canon mini-copier project members, aware
that the drum was the most frequent problem, designed a type of drum that
would last through a fair amount of usage. They then had to be creative and
design a drum that did not cost more than the mini-copier! How did they 
come up with this innovation? After long discussions, one day the leader of
the unit that had to solve this problem brought along some cans of beer, and
as the team was brainstorming, someone noted that beer cans had low costs
and used the same type of aluminum as copier drums did. The rest, as they
say, is history.
The next stage of knowledge conversion in the Nonaka and Takeuchi model
is combination (explicit-to-explicit), the process of recombining discrete pieces
of explicit knowledge into a new form. Some examples would be a synthesis
in the form of a review report, a trend analysis, a brief executive summary, or
a new database to organize content. No new knowledge is created per se; it is
a new combination or representation of existing or already explicit knowledge.
In other words, combination occurs when concepts are sorted and systematized
in a knowledge system. Some examples would be populating a database when
we teach, when we categorize and combine concepts, or when we convert
explicit knowledge into a new medium such as a computer-based tutorial. For
example, in developing a training course or curriculum for a university course,
existing, explicit knowledge would be recombined into a form that better lends
itself to teaching and to transferring this content.
Another example is that of Kraft General Foods when it planned and devel-
oped a new point-of-sale (POS) system, one that would track not only items
sold but also information about the buyers. Its intent was to use this infor-
mation to plan new models to sell, new combinations of products, of products
and services, of services, and so on. The POS system collects and analyzes 
information and then helps marketing people to plan information-intensive
marketing programs called micro-merchandising.
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT MODELS 55
The last conversion process, internalization (explicit-to-tacit), occurs
through diffusing and embedding newly acquired behavior and newly under-
stood or revised mental models. Internalization is strongly linked to “learning
by doing.”
Internalization converts or integrates shared and/or individual experiences
and knowledge into individual mental models. Once internalized, new knowl-
edge is then used by employees who broaden it, extend it, and reframe it within
their own existing tacit knowledge bases. They understand, learn, and buy into
the new knowledge, and this is manifested as an observable change; that is,
they now do their jobs and tasks differently.
For example, General Electric has developed a system of documenting all
customer complaints and inquiries in a database that can be accessed by all its
employees. This system allows the employees to ﬁnd answers to new customers’
questions much more quickly because it facilitates the sharing of employees’
experiences in problem solving. This system also helps the workers to inter-
nalize others’ experiences in answering questions and solving problems.
Knowledge, experiences, best practices, lessons learned, and so on go
through the conversion processes of socialization, externalization, and combi-
nation, but they cannot halt at any one of these stages. Only when knowledge
is internalized into individuals’ tacit knowledge bases in the form of shared
mental models or technical know-how does this knowledge become a valuable
asset to the individual, to their community of practice, and to the organiza-
tion. In order for organizational knowledge creation to take place, however,
the entire conversion process has to begin all over again: the tacit knowledge
accumulated at the individual level needs to be socialized with other organi-
zational members, thereby starting a new spiral of knowledge creation
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995, p. 69). When experiences and information are
transferred through observation, imitation, and practice, then we are back in
the socialization quadrant. This knowledge is then formalized and converted
into explicit knowledge, through use of analogy, metaphor, and model, in the
externalization quadrant. This explicit knowledge is then systematized and
recombined in the combination quadrant, whereupon it once again becomes
part of individuals’ experiences. In the internalization quadrant, knowledge has
once again become tacit knowledge.
Knowledge Spiral
Knowledge creation is not a sequential process. Rather, it depends on a 
continuous and dynamic interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge
throughout the four quadrants. The knowledge spiral (see Figure 3-2) shows
how organizatins articulate, organize and systematize individual tacit knowl-
edge. Organizations produce and develop tools, structures, and models to accu-
mulate and share knowledge. The knowledge spiral is a continuous activity of
knowledge ﬂow, sharing, and conversion by individuals, communities, and the
organization itself.
The two steps in the knowledge spiral that are the most difﬁcult are those
involving a change in the type of knowledge, namely, externalization, which
converts tacit into explicit knowledge, and internalization, which converts
56 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
explicit into tacit knowledge. These two steps require a high degree of personal
commitment, and they will typically involve mental models, personal beliefs
and values, and a process of reinventing yourself, your group, and the organi-
zation as a whole. A metaphor is a good way of expressing this “inexpress-
ible” content. For example, a slogan, a story, an analogy, or a symbol of some
type can encapsulate complex contextual meanings. A metaphor is often used
to convey two ideas in a single phrase and may be deﬁned as “accomplishes
in a word or phrase what could otherwise be expressed only in many words,
if at all” (Sommer and Weiss, 1995, p. vii). All of these vehicles are good models
for representing a consistent, systematic, and logical understanding of content
without any contradictions. The better and the more coherent the model, and
the better the model ﬁts with existing mental models, the higher the likelihood
of successful implementation of a knowledge spiral.
It is possible to structure metaphors, models, and analogies in an organiza-
tional KM design. The ﬁrst principle is to have built-in redundancy to make
sure information overlaps. Redundancy will make it easier to articulate
content, to share content, and to make use of it. An example is to set up several
competing groups, to build in a rotational strategy so that workers do a variety
of jobs, and to provide easy access to company information via a single inte-
grated knowledge base.
Knowledge sharing and use occurs through the “knowledge spiral,” which,
“starting at the individual level and moving up through expanding communi-
ties of interaction, ...c r osses sectional, departmental, divisional and organi-
zational boundaries” (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995, p. 72). Nonaka and
Takeuchi argue that an organization has to promote a facilitating context in
which the organizational knowledge-creation process and the individual one
can easily take place, acting as a spiral. They describe the following “Enabling
Conditions for Organizational Knowledge Creation”:

1. Intention: an organization’s aspiration to its goals (strategy formulation
in a business setting).
2. Autonomy: condition whereby individuals act autonomously, according
to the “minimum critical speciﬁcation” principle, and are involved in
cross-functional self-organized teams.
3. Fluctuation and Creative Chaos: condition that stimulates the interac-
tion between the organization and the external environment and/or
creates ﬂuctuations and breakdowns by means of creative chaos or
strategic equivocality.
4. Redundancy: existence of information that goes beyond the immediate
operational requirements of organizational members; competing multi-
ple teams on the same issue; and strategic rotation of personnel.
5. Requisite Variety: internal diversity to match the variety and complex-
ity of the environment, and to provide everyone in the organization with
the fastest access to the broadest variety of necessary information; ﬂat
and ﬂexible organizational structure interlinked with effective informa-
tion networks.
The Nonaka and Takeuchi model has proven to be one of the more robust
ones in the ﬁeld of KM, and it continues to be applied in a variety of settings.
One of its greatest strengths is its simplicity—both in terms of understanding
the basic tenets of the model and in terms of being able to quickly internalize
and apply the KM model. One of its major shortcomings is that, through valid,
it does not appear to be sufﬁcient to explain all of the stages involved in man-
aging knowledge. The Nonaka and Takeuchi model focuses on the knowledge
transformations between tacit and explicit knowledge, but the model does not
address larger issues of how decision making takes place by leveraging both
forms of knowledge.
The Choo Sense-making KM Model
Choo (1998) has described a model of knowledge management that stresses
sense making (largely based on Weick, 2001), knowledge creation (based on
Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995) and decision making (based on, among other
concepts, bounded rationality; see Simon, 1957). The Choo KM model focuses
on how information elements are selected and subsequently fed into organi-
zational actions. Organizational action results from the concentration and
absorption of information from the external environment into each successive
cycle, as illustrated in Figure 3-3. Each phase, sense making, knowledge cre-
ation, and decision making, has an outside stimulus or trigger.
In the sense-making stage, one attempts to make sense of the information
streaming in from the external environment. Priorities are identiﬁed and used
to ﬁlter the information. Individuals construct common interpretations from
the exchange and negotiate information fragments combined with their previ-
ous experiences. Weick (2001) proposed a theory of sense making to describe
how chaos is transformed into sensible and orderly processes in an organiza-
tion through the shared interpretation of individuals. Loosely coupled system
is a term used to describe systems that can be taken apart or revised without
58 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
damaging the entire system. A human being is “tightly coupled,” whereas the
human genome is “loosely coupled.” Loose coupling permits adaptation, evo-
lution, and extension. Sense making can be thought of as a loosely coupled
system whereby individuals construct their own representation of reality by
comparing current with past events.
Weick (2001) proposes that sense making in organizations consists of four
integrated processes: (1) ecological change, (2) enactment, (3) selection, and
(4) retention.
Ecological change is a change in the environment that is external to the
organization—one that disturbs the ﬂow of information to participants—
and triggers an ecological change in the organization. Organizational actors
enact their environment by attempting to closely examine elements of the 
environment.
In the enactment phase, people try to construct, rearrange, single out, or
demolish speciﬁc elements of content. Many of the objective features of their
environment are made less random and more orderly through the creation of
their own constraints or rules. Enactment clariﬁes the content and issues to be
used for the subsequent selection process.
Selection and retention are the phases in which individuals attempt to inter-
pret the rationale for the observed and enacted changes by making selections.
The retention process in turn furnishes the organization with an organizational
memory of successful sense-making experiences. This memory can be reused
in the future to interpret new changes and to stabilize individual interpreta-
tions into a coherent organizational view of events and actions. These phases

also serve to reduce any uncertainty and ambiguity associated with unclear,

Knowledge creating may be viewed as the transformation of personal 
knowledge between individuals through dialogue, discourse, sharing, and 
storytelling. This phase is directed by a knowledge vision of “as is” (current
situation) and “to be” (future, desired state). Knowledge creation widens the
spectrum of potential choices in decision making by providing new knowledge
and new competencies. The result feeds the decision-making process with inno-
vative strategies that extend the organization’s capability to make informed,
rational decisions. Choo (1998) draws upon the Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)
model for a theoretical basis of knowledge creation.
