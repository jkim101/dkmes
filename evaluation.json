        "question": "What is Knowledge Management (KM) and why is it critical for an organization?",
        "answer": "Knowledge Management is the systematic process of identifying, creating, representing, distributing, and applying information to support organizational objectives. It is critical because it prevents redundant work, accelerates decision-making, and fosters innovation by leveraging the organization's collective intelligence."

        "question": "What is the difference between Tacit Knowledge and Explicit Knowledge?",
        "answer": "Tacit knowledge is intuitive, rooted in personal experience, and difficult to codify (e.g., know-how, insights). Explicit knowledge is codified information that can be easily documented, stored, and shared (e.g., manuals, databases). A key challenge in KM is converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge."

        "question": "Explain the four stages of the SECI model.",
        "answer": "The SECI model describes the knowledge creation spiral: 1) Socialization (Tacit to Tacit), 2) Externalization (Tacit to Explicit), 3) Combination (Explicit to Explicit), and 4) Internalization (Explicit to Tacit). This process illustrates how knowledge expands through continuous conversion."

        "question": "What roles do Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs play in Knowledge Management?",
        "answer": "An Ontology defines the semantic relationships between concepts, while a Knowledge Graph applies this structure to link actual data in a network. They enable AI agents to go beyond keyword search to understand context and uncover hidden relationships between disparate data points for more accurate reasoning."

        "category": "AI Integration",
        "question": "What are the benefits of integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Knowledge Management System?",
        "answer": "RAG allows LLMs to reference an organization's internal, up-to-date knowledge base in real-time when generating responses. This significantly reduces hallucinations, ensures answers reflect the latest internal data, and eliminates the need to constantly retrain the model."

        "question": "What are the typical stages of the Knowledge Lifecycle?",
        "answer": "The lifecycle typically includes: 1) Creation/Capture, 2) Storage & Organization, 3) Sharing & Dissemination, 4) Application/Utilization, and 5) Update & Archiving/Disposal."

        "question": "What are the main barriers (silos) to knowledge sharing in an organization, and how can they be mitigated?",
        "answer": "Major barriers include departmental protectionism, lack of incentives, and complex tools. Mitigation strategies include establishing reward systems for sharing, fostering a collaborative culture, and implementing a unified, user-friendly knowledge platform (Single Source of Truth)."

        "category": "Evaluation Metrics",
        "question": "What are key KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring the success of Knowledge Management?",
        "answer": "Key KPIs include Knowledge Contribution Rate (docs created), Knowledge Utilization (views/downloads), reduction in search time, reduction in redundant inquiries, and the success rate of problem-solving using the knowledge base."

        "question": "Why are Knowledge Curation and Data Stewardship important for AI-driven KM?",
        "answer": "They ensure the accuracy, recency, and quality of the knowledge base. Since AI agents rely on this data, poor quality ('garbage in') leads to poor performance ('garbage out')"
