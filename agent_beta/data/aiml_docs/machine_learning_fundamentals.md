# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled data to train models
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, t-SNE

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns through trial and error
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients

## Popular ML Frameworks

1. **TensorFlow** - Google's open-source ML framework
2. **PyTorch** - Facebook's dynamic neural network library
3. **Scikit-learn** - Simple and efficient tools for data analysis
4. **Keras** - High-level neural networks API

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of:
- **Input Layer**: Receives input data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information
- **Output Layer**: Produces final output

### Common Architectures
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - for images
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - for sequences
- Transformers - for NLP tasks

## Training Process

1. **Forward Propagation**: Input flows through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Measure prediction error
3. **Backpropagation**: Compute gradients
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust parameters using optimizer (SGD, Adam, etc.)

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
- **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Clustering**: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index
